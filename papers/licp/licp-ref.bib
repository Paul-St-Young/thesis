abstract = {The collective approach to a Fermi gas is discussed by considering the wave functions of non-interacting Fermi gases in one and three dimensions, and of the interacting Fermi gas. It is shown how to write the one-dimensional case exactly in terms of collective coordinates, and how these have a well defined existence for long wavelengths even without interaction. This is extended as far as possible to three dimensions, and it is shown how the statistics affect the collective motion in the presence of interaction. A brief discussion is given of how calculations may be performed when redundant sets of coordinates are used.},

Results are presented for the Fermi surfaces and quasiparticle velocities of Li, Rb and Cs implied by three separate approximations for the mass operator. Comparison with experiment indicates that a non-local energy-dependent mass operator, previously suggested in the context of the density functional formalism, is a good approximation for simple metals. Comparison with the more commonly used local mass operator approximations show that a more accurate description of many-body effects results in a reduction of Fermi surface distortions and quasiparticle mass anisotropies by a factor of around two. In addition, a substantial electron-electron renormalisation of the average quasiparticle mass is predicted in Li and Cs despite the absence of a large renormalisation in the uniform electron gas.}

The lithium is in the form of a dispersion of micrometre sized grains embedded in wax in order to suppress the low temperature martensitic transformation. A full characterisation of the lithium Fermi surface geometry is not possible, but the overall distortion in area is found to be 3.00+or-0.02%, from which the radial distortion is estimated as 4.8+or-0.3%. These distortions are significantly higher than those found by the many-body density functional calculations of Macdonald and the positron annihilation experiments of Oberli et al. The authors obtain from the measurements a probability distribution of de Haas-van Alphen frequencies over the whole Fermi surface. The cyclotron electron effective mass is measured as (2.10+or-0.06)m0. This work is an attempt to improve on the earlier work of Randles and Springford by exploiting the higher magnetic fields (13 T) and lower temperatures (20 mK) now available.}

                   theoretical profiles employing the local density
                   approximation–based band theory framework.
                   Extensive comparisons between the computed and

                   their interplay with inelastic scattering
                   experiments. We resolve various anomalies contained
                   in the data, which were originally viewed as
                   signatures of strong dynamical electronic
                   correlations; we show that, instead, the anomalies
                   are due to band-structure effects. The underlying
                   theoretical framework in our density-response
                   calculations is time-dependent density-functional
                   theory; with this scheme we discuss the lifetime of
                   the K plasmon, and the dynamical structure factor of
                   Al. From a self-consistent solution of the Dyson
                   equation in the GW approximation for the electron
                   self-energy, we discuss the electron momentum density

                   thinking about electronic excitations in real

                   treatment of dynamical correlations for realistic
                   representations of the band structure.},

                   treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as
                   benchmarks against which other techniques may be

                   physics of electronic correlation in real materials.
                   The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and

	abstract = {QMCPACK is an open source quantum Monte Carlo package for ab initio electronic structure calculations. It supports calculations of metallic and insulating solids, molecules, atoms, and some model Hamiltonians. Implemented real space quantum Monte Carlo algorithms include variational, diffusion, and reptation Monte Carlo. QMCPACK uses Slater–Jastrow type trial wavefunctions in conjunction with a sophisticated optimizer capable of optimizing tens of thousands of parameters. The orbital space auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method is also implemented, enabling cross validation between different highly accurate methods. The code is specifically optimized for calculations with large numbers of electrons on the latest high performance computing architectures, including multicore central processing unit and graphical processing unit systems. We detail the program’s capabilities, outline its structure, and give examples of its use in current research calculations. The package is available at http://qmcpack.org.}

  abstract =      {The management of simulation workflows represents a
                   significant task for the individual computational
                   researcher. Automation of the required tasks involved
                   in simulation work can decrease the overall time to
                   solution and reduce sources of human error. A new
                   simulation workflow management system, Nexus, is
                   presented to address these issues. Nexus is capable
                   of automated job management on workstations and
                   resources at several major supercomputing centers.
                   Its modular design allows many quantum simulation
                   codes to be supported within the same framework.
                   Current support includes quantum Monte Carlo
                   calculations with QMCPACK, density functional theory
                   calculations with Quantum Espresso or VASP, and
                   quantum chemical calculations with GAMESS. Users can
                   compose workflows through a transparent, text-based
                   interface, resembling the input file of a typical
                   simulation code. A usage example is provided to
                   illustrate the process. Program summary Program

It is studied how some characteristic ground-state properties and the Compton profiles depend on these choices.

                   functions for a two-component system of electrons and

                   formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band
                   structure calculations, we analyze the use and the
                   analytical form of the backflow function from
                   different points of view. The resulting wave
                   functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte
                   Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid
                   and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas,
                   the purely analytic backflow and three-body form
                   gives lower energies than those of previous
                   calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and
                   optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to
                   energies nearly as low as those from using local
                   density approximation orbitals in the trial wave
                   function. However, compared to wave functions
                   constructed from density functional solutions,
                   backflow wave functions have the advantage of only
                   few parameters to estimate, the ability to include
                   easily and accurately electron-electron correlations,
                   and that they can be directly generalized from the

                   experimental Compton profiles measured at synchrotron
                   radiation sources have raised questions on the
                   validity of the impulse approximation and the
                   strength of the electron-electron interaction in
                   metals. However, asymmetry and broadening can also be
                   introduced by experimental artifacts. In order to
                   address these issues we have made a systematic study
                   on simple systems using various incident photon
                   energies and different spectrometers. In addition, we
                   have performed simulations on the effect of dead time
                   and an asymmetric instrument function in the measured
                   Compton profiles. We conclude that the observed
                   asymmetry of Compton profiles of Be and Na does not
                   originate from any experimental artifacts, but is due
                   to the failure of the impulse approximation. This is
                   confirmed by quasi-self consistent field calculations
                   of the core electron Compton profiles, which agree
                   quite well with the experimental results.
