abstract = {An overview of the development, implementation and application of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to electronic structure calculations of real systems such as atoms, molecules and solids is presented. The relation of QMC to traditional approaches is discussed and the basic notions of variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods are introduced. The QMC applications are illustrated on calculations of excited states of transition metal atoms, energy ordering of Si and C clusters, and cohesive energies and excitations in insulating solids. Comparisons with other methods indicate the QMC advantages in accuracy, scaling in the number of electrons and scalability on parallel architectures. The variety of treated systems demonstrates the usefulness and wide applicability of this approach. The presented results show that QMC is providing a new alternative and is becoming a powerful tool for ab initio electronic structure calculations.},

abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques are used to calculate the one-body density matrix and excitation energies for the valence electrons of bulk silicon. The one-body density matrix and energies are obtained from a Slater-Jastrow wave function with a determinant of local density approximation (LDA) orbitals. The QMC density matrix evaluated in a basis of LDA orbitals is strongly diagonally dominant. The natural orbitals obtained by diagonalizing the QMC density matrix resemble the LDA orbitals very closely. Replacing the determinant of LDA orbitals in the wave function by a determinant of natural orbitals makes no significant difference to the quality of the wave function's nodal surface, leaving the diffusion Monte Carlo energy unchanged. The Extended Koopmans' Theorem for correlated wave functions is used to calculate excitation energies for silicon, which are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data. A diagonal approximation to the theorem, evaluated in the basis of LDA orbitals, works quite well for both the quasihole and quasielectron states. We have found that this approximation has an advantageous scaling with system size, allowing more efficient studies of larger systems.},

Devising an accurate description of these materials has long been a challenge, with these strong correlation effects historically being considered impossible or impractical to simulate computationally. Using quantum Monte Carlo techniques, we have explicitly simulated electron correlations in several cuprate materials from first principles. These simulations accurately reproduce many important physical quantities of these materials, including the interaction-induced gap and superexchange coupling between copper spins, with no additional parameters beyond fundamental constants. We further investigate the dimensionless spin-lattice coupling parameter in the parent materials, showing that it varies dramatically, between 0.1 and 1.0, depending on the interlayer. This result indicates that the lattice and magnetic degrees of freedom are not independent in these systems, which may have ramifications for the origin of superconductivity.},

Furthermore, DMC calculations of excited states at the L, Z, and the gamma point of the Brillouin zone reveal a flat upper valence band for NiO, in good agreement with Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy results. To study defect properties, we evaluated the formation energies of the neutral and charged vacancies of oxygen and nickel in NiO. A formation energy of 7.2 (0.15) eV was found for the oxygen vacancy under oxygen rich conditions. For the Ni vacancy, we obtained a formation energy of 3.2 (0.15) eV under Ni rich conditions. These results confirm that NiO occurs as a p-type material with the dominant intrinsic vacancy defect being Ni vacancy.},

We show that DMC is an accurate and practical method that can be used to characterize multiple properties of materials that are challenging for density functional theory approximations. DMC agrees with experimental measurements to within 0.3 eV, including the band-gap of ZnO, the ionization potential of O and Zn, and the atomization energy of O{\$}{\_}2{\$}, ZnO dimer, and wurtzite ZnO. DMC predicts the oxygen vacancy as a deep donor with a formation energy of 5.0(2) eV under O-rich conditions and thermodynamic transition levels located between 1.8 and 2.5 eV from the valence band maximum. Our DMC results indicate that the concentration of zinc interstitial and hydrogen impurities in ZnO should be low under n-type, and Zn- and H-rich conditions because these defects have formation energies above 1.4 eV under these conditions. Comparison of DMC and hybrid functionals shows that these DFT approximations can be parameterized to yield a general correct qualitative description of ZnO. However, the formation energy of defects in ZnO evaluated with DMC and hybrid functionals can differ by more than 0.5 eV.},

However, the framework for the calculation of properties such as total energies, atomization energies, and excited state energies is not yet fully established. Several outstanding questions remain as to the effect of pseudopotentials, the magnitude of the fixed node error, and the size of supercell finite size effects. Here, we consider in detail the semiconductors ZnSe and ZnO and carry out systematic studies to assess the magnitude of the energy differences arising from controlled and uncontrolled approximations in DMC. The former include time step errors and supercell finite size effects for ground and optically excited states, and the latter include pseudopotentials, the pseudopotential localization approximation, and the fixed node approximation. We find that for these compounds, the errors can be controlled to good precision using modern computational resources and that quantum Monte Carlo calculations using Dirac-Fock pseudopotentials can offer good estimates of both cohesive energy and the gap of these systems. We do however observe differences in calculated optical gaps that arise when different pseudopotentials are used.},

abstract = {Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a paradigmatic example of a strongly correlated system that undergoes a metal-insulator transition at a structural phase transition. To date, this transition has necessitated significant post hoc adjustments to theory in order to be described properly. Here we report standard state-of-the-art first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the structural dependence of the properties of VO2. Using this technique, we simulate the interactions between electrons explicitly, which allows for the metal-insulator transition to naturally emerge, importantly without ad hoc adjustments. The QMC calculations show that the structural transition directly causes the metal-insulator transition and a change in the coupling of vanadium spins. This change in the spin coupling results in a prediction of a momentum-independent magnetic excitation in the insulating state. While two-body correlations are important to set the stage for this transition, they do not change significantly when VO2 becomes an insulator. These results show that it is now possible to account for electron correlations in a quantitatively accurate way that is also specific to materials.},

We investigate the fixed-node errors in diffusion Monte Carlo gaps evaluated with Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions by examining the effects of backflow transformations, and also by considering the formation of restricted multideterminant expansions for excited-state wave functions. For several molecules, we examine the importance of structural relaxation in the excited state in determining excited-state energies. We study the feasibility of using variational Monte Carlo with backflow correlations to obtain accurate excited-state energies at reduced computational cost, finding that this approach can be valid. We find that diffusion Monte Carlo gap calculations can be performed with much larger time steps than are typically required to converge the total energy, at significantly diminished computational expense, but that in order to alleviate fixed-node errors in calculations on solids the inclusion of backflow correlations is sometimes necessary.},

Similarly to other 2D materials, the electronic structure of phosphorene is strongly influenced by reduced screening, making it challenging to obtain reliable predictions by single-particle density functional methods. Advanced GW techniques, which include many-body effects as perturbative corrections, are hardly consistent with each other, predicting the band gap of phosphorene with a spread of almost 1 eV, from 1.6 to 2.4 eV. Our QMC results, from infinite periodic superlattices as well as from finite clusters, predict {\$}\backslashDelta{\_}f{\$} to be about 2.4 eV, indicating that available GW results are systematically underestimating the gap. Using the recently uncovered universal scaling between the exciton binding energy and {\$}\backslashDelta{\_}f{\$}, we predict the optical gap of 1.75 eV that can be directly related to measurements even on encapsulated samples due to its robustness against dielectric environment. The QMC gaps are indeed consistent with recent experiments based on optical absorption and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. We also predict the cohesion of phosphorene to be only slightly smaller than that of the bulk crystal. Our investigations not only benchmark GW methods and experiments, but also open the field of 2D electronic structure to computationally intensive but highly predictive QMC methods which include many-body effects such as electronic correlations and van der Waals interactions explicitly.},

abstract = {Being the lightest and the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen is fascinating to physicists. In particular, the conditions of its metallization associated with a possible superconducting state at high temperature have been a matter of much debate in the scientific community, and progress in this field is strongly correlated with the advancements in theoretical methods and experimental techniques. Recently, the existence of hydrogen in a metallic state was reported experimentally at room temperature under a pressure of 260-270 GPa, but was shortly after that disputed in the light of more experiments, finding either a semimetal or a transition to an other phase. With the aim to reconcile the different interpretations proposed, we propose by combining several computational techniques, such as density functional theory and the GW approximation, that phase III at ambient temperature of hydrogen is the Cmca-12 phase, which becomes a semimetal at 260 GPa. From phonon calculations, we demonstrate it to be dynamically stable; calculated electron-phonon coupling is rather weak and therefore this phase is not expected to be a high-temperature superconductor.},

abstract = {The Kohn–Sham potential v eff ( r ) is the effective multiplicative operator in a noninteracting Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation that reproduces the ground-state density of a real (interacting) system. The sizes and shapes of atoms, molecules, and solids can be defined in terms of Kohn–Sham potentials in a nonarbitrary way that accords with chemical intuition and can be implemented efficiently, permitting a natural pictorial representation for chemistry and condensed-matter physics. Let ϵ max be the maximum occupied orbital energy of the noninteracting electrons. Then the equation v eff ( r ) = ϵ max defines the surface at which classical electrons with energy ϵ ≤ ϵ max would be turned back and thus determines the surface of any electronic object. Atomic and ionic radii defined in this manner agree well with empirical estimates, show regular chemical trends, and allow one to identify the type of chemical bonding between two given atoms by comparing the actual internuclear distance to the sum of atomic radii. The molecular surfaces can be fused (for a covalent bond), seamed (ionic bond), necked (hydrogen bond), or divided (van der Waals bond). This contribution extends the pioneering work of Z.-Z. Yang et al. [Yang ZZ, Davidson ER (1997) Int J Quantum Chem 62:47–53; Zhao DX, et al.

There is a marked difference between the coupling of the vibrational state to the valence band maximum and to the conduction band minimum. The strength of phonon coupling to the valence band maximum is similar between the three systems and is dominated by vibrations that change the bond length. The coupling strength to the conduction band minimum differs significantly in diamond, silicon carbide, and silicon. In diamond, the coupling is dominated by six small pockets of vibrational states in the phonon Brillouin zone that are ultimately responsible for the stronger electron-phonon coupling in this material.

abstract = {The supercell technique is widely spread for the simulation of charged point defects. Charged defects in a supercell are unfortunately subjected to spurious image interactions, which are usually handled by introducing two correcting terms: a Madelung-type correction that accounts for the electrostatic interactions of repeated charges in a compensating background and a potential alignment term that refers the charged supercell to the electron reservoir. We demonstrate that the Madelung correction already brings a large potential shift that slowly converges as 1/L{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}1{\textless}mo{\textgreater}/{\textless}mi{\textgreater}L with increasing supercell sizes. We hence define a potential alignment devoid of any double counting. We finally propose a simple evaluation for the nearest-neighbor interaction that removes the remaining spurious hybridization of the defect wave functions between images. The application of these three corrections together drastically speeds up the convergence with respect to supercell size for all defects that are not too shallow.},

Using the G0W0 approximation, the temperature dependence of the direct gaps of diamond, silicon, lithium fluoride, magnesium oxide, and titanium dioxide is calculated. Within the proposed formalism, a single calculation at each temperature of interest is sufficient to obtain results of the same accuracy as in alternative, more expensive methods. It is shown that many-body contributions beyond semilocal density functional theory modify the electron-phonon coupling strength by almost 50{\%} in diamond, silicon, and titanium dioxide, but by less than 5{\%} in lithium flouride and magnesium oxide. The results reveal a complex picture regarding the validity of semilocal functionals for the description of electron-phonon coupling.},

abstract = {Hydrogen, being the first element in the periodic table, has the simplest electronic structure of any atom, and the hydrogen molecule contains the simplest covalent chemical bond. Nevertheless, the phase diagram of hydrogen is poorly understood. Determining the stable structures of solid hydrogen is a tremendous experimental challenge(1-3), because hydrogen atoms scatter X-rays only weakly, leading to low-resolution diffraction patterns. Theoretical studies encounter major diffculties owing to the small energy differences between structures and the importance of the zero-point motion of the protons. We have systematically investigated the zero-temperature phase diagram of solid hydrogen using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) electronic-structure methods(4), including the proton zero-point motion at the harmonic level. Our study leads to a radical revision of the DFT phase diagram of hydrogen up to nearly 400 GPa. That the most stable phases remain insulating to very high pressures eliminates a major discrepancy between theory(5) and experiment(6). One of our new phases is calculated to be stable over a wide range of pressures, and its vibrational properties agree with the available experimental data for phase III.},

abstract = {A defect's formation energy is a key theoretical quantity that allows the calculation of equilibrium defect concentrations in solids and aids in the identification of defects that control the properties of materials and device performance, efficiency, and reliability. The theory of formation energies is rigorous only for neutral defects, but the Coulomb potentials of charged defects require additional ad hoc numerical procedures. Here we invoke statistical mechanics to derive a revised theory of charged-defect formation energies, which eliminates the need for ad hoc numerical procedures. Calculations become straightforward and transparent. We present calculations demonstrating the significance of the revised theory for defect formation energies and thermodynamic transition levels.},

abstract = {We show that the recently introduced iterative backflow wave function can be interpreted as a general neural network in continuum space with nonlinear functions in the hidden units. Using this wave function in variational Monte Carlo simulations of liquid He4 in two and three dimensions, we typically find a tenfold increase in accuracy over currently used wave functions. Furthermore, subsequent stages of the iteration procedure define a set of increasingly good wave functions, each with its own variational energy and variance of the local energy: extrapolation to zero variance gives energies in close agreement with the exact values. For two dimensional He4, we also show that the iterative backflow wave function can describe both the liquid and the solid phase with the same functional form - a feature shared with the shadow wave function, but now joined by much higher accuracy. We also achieve significant progress for liquid He3 in three dimensions, improving previous variational and fixed-node energies.},

abstract = {The fundamental energy gap of a periodic solid distinguishes insulators from metals and characterizes low-energy single-electron excitations. However, the gap in the band structure of the exact multiplicative Kohn–Sham (KS) potential substantially underestimates the fundamental gap, a major limitation of KS density-functional theory. Here, we give a simple proof of a theorem: In generalized KS theory (GKS), the band gap of an extended system equals the fundamental gap for the approximate functional if the GKS potential operator is continuous and the density change is delocalized when an electron or hole is added. Our theorem explains how GKS band gaps from metageneralized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and hybrid functionals can be more realistic than those from GGAs or even from the exact KS potential. The theorem also follows from earlier work. The band edges in the GKS one-electron spectrum are also related to measurable energies. A linear chain of hydrogen molecules, solid aluminum arsenide, and solid argon provide numerical illustrations.},

abstract = {The accurate computation of ionization potentials (IPs), within 0.10 eV, is one of the most challenging problems in modern computational chemistry. The extended Koopmans' theorem (EKT) provides a systematic direct approach to compute IPs from any level of theory. In this study, the EKT approach is integrated with the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] method for the first time. For efficiency, the density-fitting (DF) approximation is employed for electron repulsion integrals. Further, the EKT-CCSD(T) method is applied to a set of 23 molecules, denoted as IP23, for comparison with the experimental ionization potentials. For the IP23 set, the EKT-CCSD(T) method, along with the aug-cc-pV5Z basis set, provides a mean absolute error of 0.05 eV. Hence, our results demonstrate that direct computations of IPs at high-accuracy levels can be achieved with the EKT-CCSD(T) method. We believe that the present study may open new avenues in IP computations.},

@article{Bozkaya2013,
abstract = {The extended Koopmans' theorem (EKT) provides a straightforward way to compute ionization potentials (IPs) from any level of theory, in principle. However, for non-variational methods, such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation and coupled-cluster theories, the EKT computations can only be performed as by-products of analytic gradients as the relaxed generalized Fock matrix (GFM) and one- and two-particle density matrices (OPDM and TPDM, respectively) are required [J. Cioslowski, P. Piskorz, and G. Liu, J. Chem. Phys. 107, 6804 (1997)]. However, for the orbital-optimized methods both the GFM and OPDM are readily available and symmetric, as opposed to the standard post Hartree-Fock (HF) methods. Further, the orbital optimized methods solve the N-representability problem, which may arise when the relaxed particle density matrices are employed for the standard methods, by disregarding the orbital Z-vector contributions for the OPDM. Moreover, for challenging chemical systems, where spin or spatial symmetry-breaking problems are observed, the abnormal orbital response contributions arising from the numerical instabilities in the HF molecular orbital Hessian can be avoided by the orbital-optimization. Hence, it appears that the orbital-optimized methods are the most natural choice for the study of the EKT. In this research, the EKT for the orbital-optimized methods, such as orbital-optimized second- and third-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation [U. Bozkaya, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 224103 (2011)] and coupled-electron pair theories [OCEPA(0)] [U. Bozkaya and C. D. Sherrill, J. Chem. Phys. 139, 054104 (2013)], are presented. The presented methods are applied to IPs of the second- and third-row atoms, and closed- and open-shell molecules. Performances of the orbital-optimized methods are compared with those of the counterpart standard methods. Especially, results of the OCEPA(0) method (with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set) for the lowest IPs of the considered atoms and closed-shell molecules are substantially accurate, the corresponding mean absolute errors are 0.11 and 0.15 eV, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The Fermi potential, vF(r), is the nonclassical part of the multiplicative effective potential appearing in the one-particle Schr{\"{o}}dinger-type equation for the square root of the electron density. The usual way of constructing vF(r) by inverting that equation produces unsatisfactory results when applied to electron densities expanded in Gaussian basis sets. We suggest a different method that is based on an explicit formula for vF(r) in terms of the interacting one- and two-electron reduced density matrices of the system. This method is exact in the basis-set limit and yields accurate approximations to the basis-set-limit vF(r) when applied to reduced density matrices represented in terms of finite basis sets. Illustrative applications involve atomic and molecular wave functions generated at various levels of ab initio theory. It is also shown how to construct the Pauli and exchange-correlation potentials of any system starting with only vF(r).},

@article{Rohlfing1993,
abstract = {We report state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of the quasiparticle energies of prototype homopolar and heteropolar covalent semiconductors described in terms of the electron self-energy operator. The wave functions are calculated within density-functional theory using the local-density approximation and employing nonlocal, norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The self-energy operator is evaluated in the GW approximation. Employing the plasmon-pole approximation for the frequency dependence of the dielectric matrix $\epsilon$G,G'(q,$\omega$), its static part is fully calculated within the random-phase approximation (RPA) as well as by using a number of different models. All calculations are carried out employing localized Gaussian orbital basis sets. This will turn out to be very useful for detailed studies of the quasiparticle properties of more complex systems such as bulk defects including lattice relaxation and reconstructed surfaces with large unit cells or interfaces, which are otherwise computationally too demanding. Using an s,p,d,s* basis set of 40 Gaussian orbitals for Si, for example, yields already convergent results in excellent agreement with the results of a 350-plane-wave calculation in the corresponding plane-wave representation. Most of our results for Si, diamond, Ge, and GaAs are in very good agreement with experimental data and with available plane-wave GW calculations. To our knowledge, our results for SiC are the first quasiparticle energies reported so far for this important material of high current technological interest. Also in this case we find very good agreement with the available experimental data except for E(L1c). We believe that this deviation may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. In particular, we discuss and scrutinize the applicability of six different models for the static dielectric matrix $\epsilon$G,G'(q,0) in the GW approximation ranging from the simple Hartree-Fock expression over diagonal models to nondiagonal models that take the local fields within the inhomogeneous electronic charge density into account. Some of the nondiagonal models are shown to yield results in very good agreement with the full RPA results.},

@article{Feynman1954,
abstract = {It is argued that the wave function representing an excitation in liquid helium should be nearly of the form if(ri)$\phi$, where $\phi$ is the ground-state wave function, f(r) is some function of position, and the sum is taken over each atom i. In the variational principle this trial function minimizes the energy if f(r)=exp(ik•r), the energy value being E(k)={\^{a}}2k22mS(k), where S(k) is the structure factor of the liquid for neutron scattering. For small k, E rises linearly (phonons). For larger k, S(k) has a maximum which makes a ring in the diffraction pattern and a minimum in the E(k) vs k curve. Near the minimum, E(k) behaves as $\Delta$+{\^{a}}2(k-k0)22$\mu$, which form Landau found agrees with the data on specific heat. The theoretical value of $\Delta$ is twice too high, however, indicating need of a better trial function. Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view is not adequate to deal with the details of the $\lambda$ transition and with problems of critical flow velocity. In a dilute solution of He3 atoms in He4, the He3 should move essentially as free particles but of higher effective mass. This mass is calculated, in an appendix, to be about six atomic mass units. {\textcopyright} 1954 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a stochastic algorithm for finding the lowest energy many-fermion wave function with the same nodal surface as a chosen trial function. It has proved itself among the most accurate methods available for calculating many-electron ground states, and is one of the few approaches that can be applied to systems large enough to act as realistic models of solids. In attempts to use fixed-node DMC for excited-state calculations, it has often been assumed that the DMC energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the lowest exact eigenfunction with the same symmetry as the trial function. We show that this assumption is not justified unless the trial function transforms according to a one-dimensional irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. If the trial function transforms according to a multidimensional irreducible representation, corresponding to a degenerate energy level, the DMC energy may lie below the energy of the lowest eigenstate of that symmetry. Weaker variational bounds may then be obtained by choosing trial functions transforming according to one-dimensional irreducible representations of subgroups of the full symmetry group. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A combination of ultraviolet and inverse photoemission is often used to determine the position of the transport levels of semiconductors. Although data from direct methods like photoemission appear advantageous at first glance, large discrepancies between thus-derived band gaps and optically measured band gaps have led to fundamentally different evaluation methods of the data from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)/inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPS) experiments, the essential alternatives being the maxima or the onsets of the frontier peaks. In this paper, we review published data as well as present new experimental data for a few representative II-VI and III-V compound and element semiconductors. New data from silicon are utilized as examples for evaluating details of such combined UPS and IPS spectra and for answering the question of how surface effects, especially the consequences of surface reconstruction, can adequately be taken into account. The results clearly indicate that, for all three types of semiconductors, only peak onsets represent the correct band positions. Possible reasons for this finding are discussed, and an explanation in the framework of relaxation (i.e., dynamical screening) is suggested.},

abstract = {By making the assumption that the addition (subtraction) of an electron from a many‐body wave function may be represented by a single spin orbital, variationally determined, two distinct one‐particle potentials are derived. They represent, respectively, the effective interaction of the (N ‐ 1)‐electron system with the Nth electron, and the effective interaction of the N‐electron system with the (N + 1)th electron. Nonlocal exchange arises because of the indistinguishability of electrons. The “core” electrons are allowed to be correlated with each other and to be polarized by the electron in question. Eigenvalues to these potentials represent, respectively, ionization potentials and electron affinities, and the eigenfunctions are variationally determined spin orbitals (“standing‐wave solutions”), termed the “natural transition orbitals.” The two‐body density matrix of a reference state approximating an eigenfunction of the many‐body Hamiltonian is required as input to the theory. Given this input, the method is linear, requiring no interations. In the limit of no correlation in the reference N‐body state (provided the occupied orbitals span the Hartree‐Fock space), the two potentials reduce to the unrestricted Hartree‐Fock potential for occupied and virtual orbitals.

The resulting wave functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using local density approximation orbitals in the trial wave function. However, compared to wave functions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wave functions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.},

@article{Perdew1985,
abstract = {How can the fundamental band gap of an insulator be predicted? As a difference of ground‐state energies, the fundamental gap seems to fall within the reach of density functional theory, yet the predicted gaps from band structure calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) are about 40{\%} too small. It is argued here that even the exact Kohn‐Sham potential veff(r), which generates the exact density in a self‐consistent‐field calculation, generates a band structure which underestimates the gap. Within the context of the band gap problem, several recent developments in the density‐functional theory of many‐electron systems are reviewed: (1) The Langreth‐Mehl approximation to the Kohn‐Sham exchange‐correlation energy and potential, based upon the Langreth‐Perdew wavevector analysis of the density gradient expansion. This functional leads to more accurate ground‐state energies and densities than those of the LDA with little change in the calculated band structures of solids. (2) The derivative discontinuity of the exchange‐correlation energy, which is responsible for substantial underestimation of the fundamental gap by even the exact Kohn‐Sham potential. (3) The self‐interaction correction, which yields accurate gaps in insulators only by virtue of its orbital‐dependent potential. (4) The density response function of the uniform electron gas, which suggests that the LDA gives a good estimate of the exact Kohn‐Sham potential for a semiconductor with a weak periodic potential. In short, several very different (but admittedly approximate) numerical calculations suggest that most of the error in the LDA fundamental gap would persist in the gap of the exact Kohn‐Sham band structure. This error would persist in any attempt to calculate the gap from LDA total energy differences for clusters of increasing size. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1985 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Given an exact eigenfunction $\psi$ for some system with N electrons, a procedure is developed for determining ionization potentials of the system to various states of the corresponding system having N-p electrons. The long-range behavior of the electron density and of the natural spin orbitals is shown to involve a set of eigenvalues which are obtained by this procedure. Following is the procedure. First determine the pth-order natural functions for $\psi$, Xm(p)and their occupation numbers nm(p)by diagonalization of the pth-order density matrix $\Gamma$(p). Calculate the quantities $\lambda$kl(p)=nl(p)〈Xk(p)(p̄)|Ĥ(p̄)|Xl(p)(p̄) 〉+p(p+1)∫(1/r1,p+1)Xk(p)* (p̄)X‡(p)(p̄$\xi$) ×$\Gamma$(p+1)(p̄$\xi$xp+1|p̄, xp+1)d$\xi$1...d$\xi$pdxp+1dx1...dxp, where p̄≡(x1x2...xp) and p̄$\xi$≡($\xi$1$\xi$2...$\xi$p). Then diagonalize the Hermitian matrix $\mu$kl(p)=$\lambda$kl(p)/[nk(p)nl(p)]1/2. The resultant eigenvalues $\mu$$\alpha$(p)are approximations to the negative of the p-electron ionization potentials of the system, with successive $\mu$$\alpha$(p)(from the highest to the lowest) being lower bounds to the negative successive p-electron ionization potentials (from the lowest to the highest). For an approximate eigenfunction $\psi$, the same procedure is recommended, except that the Hermitian part of the approximate matrix $\mu$kl(p)is diagonalized. For $\psi$ Hartree-Fock approximation to $\psi$, the procedure for the case p=1 is the classic method of Koopmans. It is shown that in general all natural spin orbitals $\chi$m(x) in a system have long-range exponential fall-off governed by $\mu$max(1), i.e., $\chi$m(x)∼exp[-(- 2$\mu$max(1))1/2r], and that the electron density behaves similarly, $\rho$(x)∼exp[-2(-2$\mu$max(1))1/2r]. The behavior naively expected, namely $\rho$(x)∼exp[-2(2Imin)1/2r], results if $\mu$max(1)is equal to -Imin. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1975 American Institute of Physics.},

At around 200 GPa, we observe the phase transformation, which we attribute to phase III, previously observed only at low temperatures. This is succeeded at 220 GPa by a reversible transformation to a new phase, IV, characterized by the simultaneous appearance of the second vibrational fundamental and newlow-frequency phonon excitations and a dramatic softening and broadening of the first vibrational fundamental mode. The optical transmission spectra of phase IV show an overall increase of absorption and a closing band gap which reaches 1.8 eVat 315GPa. Analysis of the Raman spectra suggests that phase IV is a mixture of graphenelike layers, consisting of elongated H2 dimers experiencing large pairing fluctuations, and unbound H2 molecules.},

abstract = {The metallization of high-pressure hydrogen, together with the associated molecular to atomic transition, is one of the most important problems in the field of high-pressure physics. It is also currently a matter of intense debate due to the existence of conflicting experimental reports on the observation of metallic hydrogen on a diamond-anvil cell. Theoretical calculations have typically relied on a mean-field description of electronic correlation through density functional theory, a theory with well-known limitations in the description of metal-insulator transitions. In fact, the predictions of the pressure-driven dissociation of molecules in high-pressure hydrogen by density functional theory is strongly affected by the chosen exchange-correlation functional. In this Letter, we use quantum Monte Carlo calculations to study the molecular to atomic transition in hydrogen. We obtain a transition pressure of 447(3) GPa, in excellent agreement with the best experimental estimate of the transition 450 GPa based on an extrapolation to zero band gap from experimental measurements. Additionally, we find that C2/c is stable almost up to the molecular to atomic transition, in contrast to previous density functional theory (DFT) and DFT+quantum Monte Carlo studies which predict large stability regimes for intermediary molecular phases.},

abstract = {The dielectric function and the functions directly related to it are fundamental in solid-state spectroscopy. Their derivation is based on a very general description of the reaction of a system to an external force. As long as the reaction is linear, the response is obtained according to a linear response model and the relations describing the reactions are called the linear response functions. Thus, the linear response functions are properties of the solid-state system itself and are independent of the driving force. This concept is applicable to the whole spectral range from radio waves to {\$}\gamma{\$} rays as well as to spectroscopy with particles. The linear response is formulated in time and space. Since the response is, in general, frequency- and wave vector-dependent and since it is convenient to operate with harmonic functions, a discussion in Fourier space, both with respect to time and coordinates, is more appropriate. Thus, rather than studying the response function directly the linear relation between the Fourier transform of the driving force and the Fourier transform of the system response are considered. One of the most fundamental response functions is the electric susceptibility which describes the polarization P(q, w) generated by an incident electric field E(q, w).},

abstract = {Solid atomic hydrogen is one of the simplest systems to undergo a metal-insulator transition. Near the transition, the electronic degrees of freedom become strongly correlated and their description provides a difficult challenge for theoretical methods. As a result, the order and density of the phase transition are still subject to debate. In this work, we use diffusion quantum Monte Carlo to benchmark the transition between paramagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic body centered cubic atomic hydrogen in its ground state. We locate the density of the transition by computing the equation of state for these two phases and identify the phase transition order by computing the band gap near the phase transition. These benchmark results show that the phase transition is continuous and occurs at a Wigner-Seitz radius of rs = 2.27(3) a0. We compare our results to previously reported density functional theory, Hedin's GW approximation, and dynamical mean field theory results.},

abstract = {Glutamate is a main constituent of dietary protein and is also consumed in many prepared foods as an additive in the form of monosodium glutamate. Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that glutamate is a major oxidative fuel for the gut and that dietary glutamate is extensively metabolized in first pass by the intestine. Glutamate also is an important precursor for bioactive molecules, including glutathione, and functions as a key neurotransmitter. The dominant role of glutamate as an oxidative fuel may have therapeutic potential for improving function of the infant gut, which exhibits a high rate of epithelial cell turnover. Our recent studies in infant pigs show that when glutamate is fed at higher (4-fold) than normal dietary quantities, most glutamate molecules are either oxidized or metabolized by the mucosa into other nonessential amino acids. Glutamate is not considered to be a dietary essential, but recent studies suggest that the level of glutamate in the diet can affect the oxidation of some essential amino acids, namely leucine. Given that substantial oxidation of leucine occurs in the gut, ongoing studies are investigating whether dietary glutamate affects the oxidation of leucine in the intestinal epithelial cells. Our studies also suggest that at high dietary intakes, free glutamate may be absorbed by the stomach as well as the small intestine, thus implicating the gastric mucosa in the metabolism of dietary glutamate. Glutamate is a key excitatory amino acid, and metabolism and neural sensing of dietary glutamate in the developing gastric mucosa, which is poorly developed in premature infants, may play a functional role in gastric emptying. These and other recent reports raise the question as to the metabolic role of glutamate in gastric function. The physiologic significance of glutamate as an oxidative fuel and its potential role in gastric function during infancy are discussed.},

The results confirm that as in three-dimensional systems, the LDA seriously underestimates the band gap. The quantitative agreement between QMC and GW is very good, thus providing evidence that GW calculations may serve as a reliable tool for the investigation of insulating nonmagnetic 2D systems.
