\subsection{Candidate Structure Optimization}
% modified from supp1-geo.tex
We considered three candidates C2/c-24, Cmca-4, Cmca-12 for the molecular phase and one candidate I4$_1$/amd for the atomic phase at $T=0K$ over the pressure range 350 GPa to 700 GPa. The static-lattice structures in the molecular phase are optimized by vdW-DF at constant pressure.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:hsolid-mol-press-rs}, all three molecular structures optimize to roughly the same density at each pressure.

\end{table}
In contrast, the atomic structure is optimized using DMC at constant volume.

All three molecular structures are monoclinic having $a=b\neq c$, $\alpha=\beta=90^\circ+\eta$, and $\gamma=120^\circ+\delta$. The slight distortions differ for each structure: $\eta=0$, $\delta\approx -0.5^\circ$ for Cmca-4, $\eta=0$, $\delta\approx+3.5^\circ$ for Cmca-12, and $\eta\approx0.1^\circ$, $\delta\approx-0.1^\circ$ for C2/c-24.
The evolution of the lattice parameters as a function of pressure are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-vdw-ca}(a).
Both $a$ and $c$ decrease with increasing pressure.
However, the $c/a$ ratio remains roughly constant at $1.062\pm0.003$ and $1.771\pm0.003$ for Cmca-12 and C2c-24, respectively.
In contrast, the $c/a$ ratio of the Cmca-4 structure decreases from $1.562$ at $350$ GPa to $1.530$ at $560$ GPa linearly with pressure.
Besides having slightly different unit cells, the Cmca-4 structure has only one type of H$_2$ molecule, whereas Cmca-12 and C2/c have two.

The vdW-DF optimized H$_2$ bond lengths of all three molecular structures are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-vdw-ca}(b).
The bond length in Cmca-4 is comparable to its isolated value of $1.4$ Bohr, whereas in C2/c-24 it is 3 to 4\% compressed.
One type of the H$_2$ molecules in Cmca-12 has pressure-sensitive bond length, increasing from $\sim 1.38$ Bohr at 360 GPa to $\sim 1.4$ Bohr at 560 GPa, while the other type has 3\% compressed bond length irrespective of pressure.

While the vdW-DF optimized structures in Ref.~\cite{McMinis2015} are not published, we can infer from the enthalpy-pressure relations that the same structures have been reproduced in this study. Figure~\ref{fig:dft-opt-geo} shows the enthalpy of each candidate structure relative to C2/c-24 at the vdW-DF static-lattice minimum. The results agree well with those from McMinis et al.~\cite{McMinis2015} where available.
In comparison to predictions by Drummond \textit{et al.}~\cite{Drummond2015}, our C2/c structure is slightly more stable and Cmca-4 slightly less stable.
They used BLYP rather than vdW-DF functional, so differences are expected. In fact, it is encouraging to see two different functionals give similar results (within a few meV/p).

\subsection{Supercell Construction}
% modified from supp2-static-qmc.tex
To reliably obtain QMC energy values in the thermodynamic limit, we need to tile the optimized primitive cells to sufficiently large supercells so that pair correlation functions are converged.
The remaining finite-size error can be removed using methods to be discussed in Chap.~\ref{chap:fsc}.
The supercells also need to be small enough for dynamic-ion QMC to be practical.
In the end, we chose to perform all QMC calculations using 72-atom simulation cells. Each simulation cell is tiled from the optimized unit cell using a non-diagonal supercell matrix~\cite{Lloyd-Williams2015}, which is optimized to have large distances between minimum images.
A supercell matrix in 3D is a $3\times 3$ matrix of integers that map primitive lattice vectors $\bs{a}, \bs{b}, \bs{c}$ to supercell lattice vectors  $\bs{a}_s, \bs{b}_s, \bs{c}_s$
\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\bs{a}_s \\
\bs{b}_s \\
\bs{c}_s
\end{array}\right) =
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{13} \\
S_{21} & S_{22} & S_{23} \\
S_{31} & S_{32} & S_{33}
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\bs{a} \\
\bs{b} \\
\bs{c}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}
Once a supercell is chosen, the crystal structure can be created using the following cropping method. One first tiles the atoms in the primitive cell a large number of times along each dimension, then crop out only the atoms that fall inside the supercell.
The total number of atoms in the supercell should be $\det S$ times larger than that in the primitive cell.

Non-diagonal supercell matrices can be useful for maximizing the minimum image radius, a.k.a. radius of the real-space Wigner-Seitz cell, $R_{WS}$.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-square-vs-rhombus}, a rhombus supercell provides a larger $R_{WS}$ than a square having the same area.
This is because the periodic images form a closed-packed lattice with a rhombus supercell.
If the primitive cell is square, then all diagonal supercell matrices result in square supercells. In contract, one can construct a rhombus-like supercell using a non-diagonal matrix. Arguably the more useful application of non-diagonal supercell matrix is for accessing a particular momentum to address a certain excitation~\cite{Lloyd-Williams2015}, but that is beyond the scope of this study.

The chosen supercell matrices and their resulting image radii are shown in Table~\ref{tab:hsolid-tmat72} and Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-radius}, respectively.
The inscribing radius of each supercell $R_{sc}$ are also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-radius} to give a sense of how far each supercell is from being orthorhombic. An orthorhombic cell has $R_{WS} = R_{sc}$.

\subsection{Wavefunction Optimization}

\subsubsection{Electronic Components}
For the electronic wave function, we use the standard Slater-Backflow-Jastrow form
\begin{align}
\Psi(\bs{R};\bs{R}_I) = \det e^{-U} \\
U = \sum_{\alpha,\beta} u_{\alpha\beta}(r).
\end{align}
The Jastrow and back flow functions are variationally using the electronic hamiltonian at vdW-DF optimized lattice geometries. The optimized functions at 480 GPa ($r_s\approx 1.25$) are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-static-jas-bf}.
These functions remain roughly identical across all densities explored.
The electronic components of the Jastrow and back flow functions are nearly identical for all three molecular candidates.
The largest contribution is the ``u-d'' term, which introduces correlation between unlike-spin electrons to keep them apart.

\label{fig:hsolid-static-jas-bf}
\end{figure}

Before back flow transformation, the static structure factor of the Slater determinant is quite similar to that of the unpolarized homogeneous electron gas, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-det-sk-nk}(a). However, the its momentum distribution is quite different, because the molecular structures are insulating.

\caption{Static structure factor $S_0(k)$ and momentum distribution $n_0(k)$ calculated using the Kohn-Sham determinant wave function.}
\label{fig:hsolid-det-sk-nk}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Ionic Components}
The Slater-Jastrow wavefunction has an additional product for the ions and an ion-ion Jastrow when generalized to an electron-ion system with distinguishable ions.
After optimizing using dynamic-ion VMC, the electronic Jastrow and back flow pair functions of all three molecular structures converge to the same set of functions.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-dynamic-jas-bf}, the only noticeable difference among the three structures come from the proton-proton Jastrow.

We use a product of isotropic gaussians as the wave function for the protons in the molecular structures.
The width of the gaussians are optimized using maximum overlap.
In this method, we measure the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of each proton from its ideal site, as determined by vdW-DF, and adjust the gaussian exponent in the proton wave function $C_p$ until the VMC and DMC estimates of the RMSD agree.
This method works by maximizing the overlap between the trial and ground-state wave function along the dimension controlled by $C_p$.
Since proton RMSD is a rather direct measure of the shape of the wave function and DMC pushes the VMC RMSD towards its ground-state value, the optimal $C_p$ is obtained when DMC and VMC sample the same distribution.

If $C_p$ is too large, the proton wave function will be too localized.
This results in undersampling of the ground-state wave function and is a dangerous scenario.
During the DMC run, the kinetic energy of the protons will likely have mostly small fluctuation in this case.
However, occasional spikes, which are important for an unbiased mean will occur infrequently.
If one misses or discards these spikes, then the results will be biased.
In contrast, undersampling will increase the variance of the wave function without biasing the mean.
The resultant calculation will require more time to reach a certain accuracy target, so a balance needs to be sought.

As shown as the red dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:prot-cp-opt}, we chose isotropic gaussian exponent that are close to optimal but error slightly on the side of undersampling.

\caption{Maximum overlap of the proton wave function.}
\label{fig:prot-cp-opt}
\end{figure}

The electron-ion Jastrow of the Cmca-4 Jastrow and back flow functions fall into good agreement with those from other candidate structures. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-dynamic-jas-bf}, the only noticeable difference among candidate structures is the change of the proton-proton Jastrow function.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:hsolid-results}

\subsection{Energy, Pressure, and Local Energy Variance}

The dominant variation of the total energy as pressure increases is due to compression of the electron liquid. This variation is on the order of $1 eV/p$ over the density range considered and is roughly the same for all candidate structures.
To better observe the differences among candidate structure, we plot energies and pressure relative to a reference equation of state (EOS).
We chose the DMC EOS for the C2/c-24 molecular crystal structure obtained by Drummond \textit{et al.}~\cite{Drummond2015}, because it is freely accessible online and well approximated by a quadratic polynomial in density
\begin{align}
E_0(\rho) = 2.14020118\rho^2 + 0.60521235\rho - 0.6073132,
\end{align}
where $\rho=N/\Omega$ is the electron density in bohr$^{-3}$, and $E_0$ is in hartree.

The static-lattice DMC energy and enthalpy are plotted relative to $E_0$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:static-qmc-vs-drummond}. At the same density, we obtain lower total energy than Drummond \textit{et al.} partly due to our use of vdW-DF, rather than  PBE, to optimize the crystal structure; and partly due to in the inclusion of back flow transformations. We tested that for the same geometry, DMC energy is unchanged to within 3 meV/p whether PBE or vdW-DF is used to generate the orbitals in the determinant wave function.

Relative energies are shown in meV per proton (meV/p). Each solid line is obtained using a fitted energy-volume EOS, which is obtained by fitting the finite-size corrected (FSC) total energy as a quadratic function of $\rho$. The markers are finite-size corrected simulation data without performing a fit. $P_0$ is the pressure calculated from the reference EOS $P_0=-dE_0/d\Omega$. \label{fig:static-qmc-vs-drummond}}
\end{figure}

The QMC virial pressure is shown as a function of density in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-p-vs-n}(a).
We first note that the QMC pressure is consistently lower than vdW-DF pressure at the same density.
Plotting the same data on a relative scale in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-p-vs-n}(b),
we see that the QMC virial pressure is 4.2\% and 3.2\% lower than vdW-DF pressure at 340 GPa ($r_s\approx 1.21$) and 460 GPa ($r_s\approx 1.25$), which agree well with the findings of R. C. Clay \textit{et al.}, i.e. Fig.~4 in Ref.~\cite{Clay2016}.
In this plot, we also see that the mixed estimator error is 1 to 5 GPa, so after linear extrapolation, the DMC pressure should be accurate to 1 GPa.

\label{fig:hsolid-p-vs-n}
\end{figure}

Finally, the variance of the optimized static-lattice wave functions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-v-vs-p} as a function of pressure.
The variance of the molecular structures are $7.5\sim8.5$ eV$^2$/p below $400$ GPa and increases to $8.5\sim9.5$ eV$^2$/p at $550$ GPa.
The increase in variance may be due to the closing band gaps of the molecular structures around $400$ GPa.
If true, then it may be better to generate orbitals above $400$ using the PBE functional, because it prefers metallic rather than insulating states when compared to vdW-DF.
For comparison, variance of the best analytical wave function for bcc hydrogen is $13.2(1)$ eV$^2$/p at $r_s=1.31$ (Table III in Ref.~\cite{Holzmann2003}) and $7.40(3)$ eV$^2$/p at $r_s=1.40$ (Table~2 in Ref.~\cite{Pierleoni2008}).

Small mixed-estimator error and low energy variance are hallmarks of a well-optimized wave function. We have demonstrated both in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-p-vs-n} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-v-vs-p} for the static-lattice electronic wave function.

\subsection{Effect of dynamic ions on energy and pressure}

When clamped protons are allowed to move, the energy of the electron-ion system changes in two ways.
First, proton kinetic energy contributes a sizable positive term to the total kinetic energy of the system. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-ion-energy}(d), the kinetic energy of the protons increases from $\sim 230$ meV/p at $360$ GPa ($r_s\approx 1.31$) to $\sim 265$ meV/p at $600$ GPa ($r_s\approx 1.20$), increasing by roughly $7.3$ meV/p every $50$ GPa.
Second, the electronic wavefunction changes as the protons move. Thus, the electronic potential and kinetic energies change as well.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-ion-energy}(b) and (c), the increase of the total potential energy is roughly twice that of the electron kinetic energy, which is around $80\pm20$ meV/p for all candidate structures.
In contrast to the proton kinetic energy, the increase of electron kinetic and total potential energies is insensitive to the electron density.
The increase of electron kinetic energy for C2/c-24 and i4$_1$/amd is $\sim 20$ meV/p higher, while the increase in their potential energies is $\sim 40$ meV/p lower.
The sum of all three contributions make up the total energy change from static- to dynamic-lattice, i.e. the zero-point energy (ZPE).
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-ion-energy}(a), the ZPE increases from $\sim 470$ meV/p at $360$ GPa to $\sim 510$ meV/p at $600$ GPa, i.e. $8.3$ meV/p every $50$ GPa.
Most of the density dependence of the ZPE comes from the proton kinetic energy.

\label{fig:hsolid-ion-energy}
\end{figure}

A direct consequence of the higher kinetic and potentials energies of the dynamic-lattice simulation is that the virial pressure is $\sim 20$ GPa higher than its static-lattice counterpart.
Interestingly, this brings the dynamic-lattice QMC pressures in good agreement with static-lattice vdW-DF pressures, as we saw in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-p-vs-n} that the static-lattice QMC pressures are systematically lower by $\sim 20$ GPa.
