\subsection{Candidate Structure Optimization}
% modified from supp1-geo.tex
We considered three candidates C2/c-24, Cmca-4, Cmca-12 for the molecular phase and one candidate I4$_1$/amd for the atomic phase at $T=0K$ over the pressure range 350 GPa to 700 GPa. The static-lattice structures in the molecular phase are optimized by vdW-DF at constant pressure.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:hsolid-mol-press-rs}, all three molecular structures optimize to roughly the same density at each pressure.

In contrast, the atomic structure is optimized using DMC at constant volume.

All three molecular structures are monoclinic having $a=b\neq c$, $\alpha=\beta=90^\circ+\eta$, and $\gamma=120^\circ+\delta$. The slight distortions differ for each structure: $\eta=0$, $\delta\approx -0.5^\circ$ for Cmca-4, $\eta=0$, $\delta\approx+3.5^\circ$ for Cmca-12, and $\eta\approx0.1^\circ$, $\delta\approx-0.1^\circ$ for C2/c-24.
The evolution of the lattice parameters as a function of pressure are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-vdw-ca}(a).
Both $a$ and $c$ decrease with increasing pressure.
However, the $c/a$ ratio remains roughly constant at $1.062\pm0.003$ and $1.771\pm0.003$ for Cmca-12 and C2c-24, respectively.
In contrast, the $c/a$ ratio of the Cmca-4 structure decreases from $1.562$ at $350$ GPa to $1.530$ at $560$ GPa linearly with pressure.
Besides having slightly different unit cells, the Cmca-4 structure has only one type of H$_2$ molecule, whereas Cmca-12 and C2/c have two.

The vdW-DF optimized H$_2$ bond lengths of all three molecular structures are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-vdw-ca}(b).
The bond length in Cmca-4 is comparable to its isolated value of $1.4$ Bohr, whereas in C2/c-24 it is 3 to 4\% compressed.
One type of the H$_2$ molecules in Cmca-12 has pressure-sensitive bond length, increasing from $\sim 1.38$ Bohr at 360 GPa to $\sim 1.4$ Bohr at 560 GPa, while the other type has 3\% compressed bond length irrespective of pressure.

While the vdW-DF optimized structures in Ref.~\cite{McMinis2015} are not published, we can infer from the enthalpy-pressure relations that the same structures have been reproduced in this study. Figure~\ref{fig:dft-opt-geo} shows the enthalpy of each candidate structure relative to C2/c-24 at the vdW-DF static-lattice minimum. The results agree well with those from McMinis et al.~\cite{McMinis2015} where available.
In comparison to predictions by Drummond \textit{et al.}~\cite{Drummond2015}, our C2/c structure is slightly more stable and Cmca-4 slightly less stable.
They used BLYP rather than vdW-DF functional, so differences are expected. In fact, it is encouraging to see two different functionals give similar results (within a few meV/p).

\subsection{Supercell Construction}
% modified from supp2-static-qmc.tex
To reliably obtain QMC energy values in the thermodynamic limit, we need to tile the optimized primitive cells to sufficiently large supercells so that pair correlation functions are converged.
The remaining finite-size error can be removed using methods to be discussed in Chap.~\ref{chap:fsc}.
The supercells also need to be small enough for dynamic-ion QMC to be practical.
In the end, we chose to perform all QMC calculations using 72-atom simulation cells. Each simulation cell is tiled from the optimized unit cell using a non-diagonal supercell matrix~\cite{Lloyd-Williams2015}, which is optimized to have large distances between minimum images.
A supercell matrix in 3D is a $3\times 3$ matrix of integers that map primitive lattice vectors $\bs{a}, \bs{b}, \bs{c}$ to supercell lattice vectors  $\bs{a}_s, \bs{b}_s, \bs{c}_s$
\begin{align}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\bs{a}_s \\
\bs{b}_s \\
\bs{c}_s
\end{array}\right) =
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{13} \\
S_{21} & S_{22} & S_{23} \\
S_{31} & S_{32} & S_{33}
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\bs{a} \\
\bs{b} \\
\bs{c}
\end{array}\right).
\end{align}
Once a supercell is chosen, the crystal structure can be created using the following cropping method. One first tiles the atoms in the primitive cell a large number of times along each dimension, then crop out only the atoms that fall inside the supercell.
The total number of atoms in the supercell should be $\det S$ times larger than that in the primitive cell.

Non-diagonal supercell matrices can be useful for maximizing the minimum image radius, a.k.a. radius of the real-space Wigner-Seitz cell, $R_{WS}$.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hsolid-square-vs-rhombus}, a rhombus supercell provides a larger $R_{WS}$ than a square having the same area.
This is because the images form a closed-packed lattice with a rhombus supercell.
If the primitive cell is square, then all diagonal supercell matrices result in square supercells. In contract, one can construct a supercell close to a rhombus using a non-diagonal matrix.

The chosen supercell matrices and their resulting image radii are shown in Table~\ref{tab:hsolid-tmat72} and Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-radius}, respectively.
The inscribing radius of each supercell $R_{sc}$ are also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-radius} to give a sense of how far each supercell is from being orthorhombic. An orthorhombic cell has $R_{WS} = R_{sc}$.

Relative energies are shown in meV per proton (meV/p). Each solid line is obtained using a fitted energy-volume EOS. The EOS is obtained by fitting the finite-size corrected (FSC) total energy as a quadratic function of inverse volume. The markers are finite-size corrected simulation data without performing a fit. \label{fig:static-qmc-vs-drummond}}

\subsection{Enthalpy vs. Pressure}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:static-enthalpy-vs-pressure}, enthalpies of the candidate structures are plotted relative the my C2/c reference EOS (Yang SJB N72 dskcorr). The EOSs are obtained by fitting the total energy to a quadratic function of inverse volume. The solid lines with symbols are my results. The dot-dashed lines are McMinis' relative enthalpies extracted from Fig. 1 of ref.~\cite{McMinis2015}. The dashed line is McMinis' atomic structure enthalpy shifted by 48 meV/p (1.8 mha/p) to match my energies. The dotted line is Azadi's atomic structure enthalpy.
