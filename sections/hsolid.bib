In the present paper the energy of a body-centered lattice of hydrogen is calculated as a function of the lattice constant. This energy is shown to assume its minimum value for a lattice constant which corresponds to a density many times higher than that of the ordinary, molecular lattice of solid hydrogen. This minimum-though negative-is much higher than that of the molecular form. The body-centered modification of hydrogen cannot be obtained with the present pressures, nor can the other simple metallic lattices. The chances are better, perhaps, for intermediate, layer-like lattices.},

@article{Drozdov2015,
abstract = {A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance below a superconducting transition temperature, Tc. The highest Tc that has been achieved to date is in the copper oxide system: 133 kelvin at ambient pressure and 164 kelvin at high pressures. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconductors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition temperatures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high Tc with no theoretical upper bound - all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of states. These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen, as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling. Numerous calculations support this idea and have predicted transition temperatures in the range 50-235 kelvin for many hydrides, but only a moderate Tc of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally. Here we investigate sulfur hydride, where a Tc of 80 kelvin has been predicted. We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approximately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of superconductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with magnetic field, with magnetic susceptibility measurements confirming a Tc of 203 kelvin. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of Tc in sulfur deuteride is suggestive of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is consistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-Tc superconductivity in this system is likely to be H3S, formed from H2S by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other hydrogen-based materials.},

@article{Errea2020,
abstract = {The discovery of superconductivity at 200 kelvin in the hydrogen sulfide system at high pressures1 demonstrated the potential of hydrogen-rich materials as high-temperature superconductors. Recent theoretical predictions of rare-earth hydrides with hydrogen cages2,3 and the subsequent synthesis of LaH10 with a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 250 kelvin4,5 have placed these materials on the verge of achieving the long-standing goal of room-temperature superconductivity. Electrical and X-ray diffraction measurements have revealed a weakly pressure-dependent Tc for LaH10 between 137 and 218 gigapascals in a structure that has a face-centred cubic arrangement of lanthanum atoms5. Here we show that quantum atomic fluctuations stabilize a highly symmetrical Fm3 ¯ m crystal structure over this pressure range. The structure is consistent with experimental findings and has a very large electron–phonon coupling constant of 3.5. Although ab initio classical calculations predict that this Fm3 ¯ m structure undergoes distortion at pressures below 230 gigapascals2,3, yielding a complex energy landscape, the inclusion of quantum effects suggests that it is the true ground-state structure. The agreement between the calculated and experimental Tc values further indicates that this phase is responsible for the superconductivity observed at 250 kelvin. The relevance of quantum fluctuations calls into question many of the crystal structure predictions that have been made for hydrides within a classical approach and that currently guide the experimental quest for room-temperature superconductivity6–8. Furthermore, we find that quantum effects are crucial for the stabilization of solids with high electron–phonon coupling constants that could otherwise be destabilized by the large electron–phonon interaction9, thus reducing the pressures required for their synthesis.},

abstract = {Hydrogen has been an essential element in the development of atomic, molecular and condensed matter physics1. It is predicted that hydrogen should have a metal state2; however, understanding the properties of dense hydrogen has been more complex than originally thought, because under extreme conditions the electrons and protons are strongly coupled to each other and ultimately must both be treated as quantum particles3,4. Therefore, how and when molecular solid hydrogen may transform into a metal is an open question. Although the quest for metal hydrogen has pushed major developments in modern experimental high-pressure physics, the various claims of its observation remain unconfirmed57. Here a discontinuous change of the direct bandgap of hydrogen, from 0.6 electronvolts to below 0.1 electronvolts, is observed near 425 gigapascals. This result is most probably associated with the formation of the metallic state because the nucleus zero-point energy is larger than this lowest bandgap value. Pressures above 400 gigapascals are achieved with the recently developed toroidal diamond anvil cell8, and the structural changes and electronic properties of dense solid hydrogen at 80 kelvin are probed using synchrotron infrared absorption spectroscopy. The continuous downward shifts of the vibron wavenumber and the direct bandgap with increased pressure point to the stability of phase-III hydrogen up to 425 gigapascals. The present data suggest that metallization of hydrogen proceeds within the molecular solid, in good agreement with previous calculations that capture many-body electronic correlations9.},

The spectrum exhibits a sharp vibron band at higher frequency and lower intensity than that for phase III, indicating the stability of molecular H2 with decreased intermolecular interactions and charge transfer between molecules. A low-frequency vibron having a strong negative pressure shift indicative of strongly interacting molecules is also observed. The character of the spectrum is consistent with an anisotropic, mixed layer structure related to those recently predicted theoretically. Phase IV was found to be stable from 220 GPa (300 K) to at least 340 GPa (near 200 K), with the I-III-IV triple point located.

In the experiments on H2 and D2, the compressional sound velocity has been measured; the Poisson's ratio has been determined by combining these data with the previously reported equation of state. At room temperature, the difference between the adiabatic and isothermal processes vanishes above 25 GPa but cannot be neglected at lower pressure. Theoretically, all five elastic constants of hcp hydrogen have been calculated, and various derived elastic quantities are presented. The elastic anisotropy of hcp hydrogen was found to be significant, with $\Delta$P1.2,$\Delta$S11.7, and $\Delta$S21. Calculations suggest the Poisson's ratio to decrease with pressure reaching a minimum value of 0.28 at 145 GPa. In the experiment, the Poisson's ratio is also found to decrease with pressure. Theoretical calculations show that the inclusion of zero-point vibrations on the elastic properties of H2 does not result in any drastic changes of the behavior of the elastic quantities.},

abstract = {Almost 80 years ago it was predicted that, under sufficient compression, the H-H bond in molecular hydrogen (H 2) would break, forming a new, atomic, metallic, solid state of hydrogen. Reaching this predicted state experimentally has been one of the principal goals in high-pressure research for the past 30 years. Here, using in situ high-pressure Raman spectroscopy, we present evidence that at pressures greater than 325 gigapascals at 300 kelvin, H 2 and hydrogen deuteride (HD) transform to a new phase - phase V. This new phase of hydrogen is characterized by substantial weakening of the vibrational Raman activity, a change in pressure dependence of the fundamental vibrational frequency and partial loss of the low-frequency excitations. We map out the domain in pressureerature space of the suggested phase V in H 2 and HD up to 388 gigapascals at 300 kelvin, and up to 465 kelvin at 350 gigapascals; we do not observe phase V in deuterium (D 2). However, we show that the transformation to phase IV in D 2 occurs above 310 gigapascals and 300 kelvin. These values represent the largest known isotropic shift in pressure, and hence the largest possible pressure difference between the H 2 and D 2 phases, which implies that the appearance of phase V of D 2 must occur at a pressure of above 380 gigapascals. These experimental data provide a glimpse of the physical properties of dense hydrogen above 325 gigapascals and constrain the pressure and temperature conditions at which the new phase exists. We speculate that phase V may be the precursor to the non-molecular (atomic and metallic) state of hydrogen that was predicted 80 years ago.},

abstract = {Molecular hydrogen is expected to exhibit metallic properties under megabar pressures. This metal is predicted to be superconducting with a very high critical temperature, Tc, of 200-400K (ref.), and it may acquire a new quantum state as a metallic superfluid and a superconducting superfluid. It may potentially be recovered metastably at ambient pressures. However, experiments carried out at low temperatures, T{\textless}100K (refs,), showed that at record pressures of 300GPa, hydrogen remains in the molecular insulating state. Here we report on the transformation of normal molecular hydrogen at room temperature (295K) to a conductive and metallic state. At 200GPa the Raman frequency of the molecular vibron strongly decreased and the spectral width increased, evidencing a strong interaction between molecules. Deuterium behaved similarly. Above 220GPa, hydrogen became opaque and electrically conductive. At 260-270GPa, hydrogen transformed into a metal as the conductance of hydrogen sharply increased and changed little on further pressurizing up to 300GPa or cooling to at least 30K; and the sample reflected light well. The metallic phase transformed back at 295K into molecular hydrogen at 200GPa. This significant hysteresis indicates that the transformation of molecular hydrogen into a metal is accompanied by a first-order structural transition presumably into a monatomic liquid state. Our findings open an avenue for detailed and comprehensive studies of metallic hydrogen. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

The quadrupole-quadrupole interaction gives the dominant anisotropic contribution up to at least 40 GPa and leads to a splitting of the J=02 rotational transition into three equally spaced branches. In the framework of the Van Kranendonk theory, the effect of the anisotropic interaction can be accounted for and the remaining variation of the roton frequency is then related to the change of the bond length of the H2 molecule, Rintra. The present determination of Rintrais semiquantitatively valid but points to an interesting variation, with a minimum around 30 GPa. By analogy with measurements done on I2 and Br2, and with ab initio calculations, this demonstrates the importance of charge-transfer interaction in dense H2, even at pressures which are far from the regime of molecular dissociation. {\textcopyright} 1991 The American Physical Society.},

A remarkable macroscopic consequence is the existence of a pressure-induced broken symmetry phase transition, in which the molecules go from a spherical rotational state to an anisotropic rotational state. Theoretical understanding of the broken symmetry phase structure remains controversial, despite numerous studies. Some open questions concern the existence of long- or short-range orientational order; whether a strong isotopic shift on the transition pressure should be assigned to the nuclear zero-point motion or to quantum localization; and whether the structures are cubic, hexagonal or orthorhombic. Here we present experimental data on the structure of the broken symmetry phase in solid D 2, obtained by a combination of neutron and X-ray diffraction up to 60 GPa. Our data are incompatible with orthorhombic structures predicted by recent theoretical works. We find that the broken symmetry phase structure is incommensurate with local orientational order, being similar to that found in metastable cubic para-D2.},

Through a series of low-temperature experiments at high pressures, we observe phase III-to-IV transformation, imposing constraints on the P-T phase diagrams. The spectral features of the phase IV-III transition and differences in appearances of the isotopes Raman spectra strongly indicate the presence of proton tunneling in phase IV. No differences between isotopes were observed in absorption spectroscopic studies, resulting in identical values for the band gap. The extrapolation of the combined band gap yields 375 GPa as the minimum transition pressure to the metallic state of hydrogen (deuterium).

abstract = {The Raman spectra of compressed hydrogen (deuterium) have been measured in the multi-Mbar pressure range in the diamond anvil cell using the position of the stressed first-order Raman diamond edge (DE) to estimate pressure. We find that the Raman spectra are very consistent in repeated experiments for the critical frequencies of the hydrogen (deuterium) bands at the phase transition pressure-temperature (P-T) points. However, measurements of pressure determined from the DE in different experiments vary substantially with virtually identical Raman spectra of H2 (D2), giving in some cases a pressure variation as high as 20 GPa. These variations do not only depend on sample and sample chamber geometry but also on the P-T path taken, thus making the DE pressure determination uncertain. Therefore, we propose in experiments on hydrogen (deuterium) to use the Raman frequency of the intramolecular vibration (vibron) of H2(D2) as a pressure sensor. By comparing the vibron frequencies and considering the geometrical changes of the sample chamber caused by very high pressures, we propose an alternative explanation to the recent claims of a transformation to a metallic liquid state of hydrogen (deuterium). {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The quest for metallic hydrogen at high pressures represents a longstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Recent calculations have predicted that solid hydrogen should become a molecular metal at pressures above 300 GPa, before transforming into an alkali metal; but the strong quantum nature of the problem makes the predictions difficult. Over a decade ago, an optical study of hydrogen was made using a diamond anvil cell to reach 250 GPa. However, despite many subsequent efforts, quantitative studies at higher pressures have proved difficult and their conclusions controversial. Here we report optical measurements of solid hydrogen up to a pressure of 320 GPa at 100 K. The vibron signature of the H2 molecule persists to at least 316 GPa; no structural changes are detected above 160 GPa, and solid hydrogen is observed to turn completely opaque at 320 GPa. We measure the absorption edge of hydrogen above 300 GPa, observing features characteristic of a direct electronic bandgap. This is at odds with the most recent theoretical calculations that predict much larger direct transition energies and the closure of an indirect gap. We predict that metal hydrogen should be observed at about 450 GPa when the direct gap closes.},

The measurements were made possible as a result of the development of new techniques for containing and probing the hot, dense fluid, which is of fundamental importance in physics, planetary science, and astrophysics. A pronounced discontinuous softening of the molecular vibron was found at elevated temperatures along with a large broadening and decrease in intensity of the roton bands. These phenomena indicate the existence of a state of the fluid having significantly modified intramolecular bonding. The results are consistent with the existence of a pressure-induced transformation in the fluid related to the presence of a temperature maximum in the melting line as a function of pressure.},

In addition, discontinuities in Raman frequencies are observed as a function of pressure and temperature indicative of phase transition at these conditions. The appearance of a new Raman feature near 2700 cm-1 at 300 GPa and 370 K indicates the transformation to a new crystalline phase.

We have performed a group-theoretical analysis of IR and Raman activity for the vibrational modes of proposed space groups to aid in determining the structures of the various phases. From a comparison of the theoretical analysis with experimental results, candidate structures for the various phases are selected. The best candidates have underlying molecular centers which form hcp lattices in both the broken-symmetry phase (BSP) and the deuterium-A (D-A) phases; the molecules in each phase are orientationally ordered along crystalline directions not coinciding with the c axis. The hcp-c structure has been excluded. We have also analyzed the mode frequencies and integrated intensities in these phases to determine the order parameters for the structures. From the temperature dependence of the order parameters a determination of the order of the phase transition can be made. The D-A phase does not end in a critical point, but rather a triple point with a phase line separating the low pressure phase and the D-A phase, above the triple point. Our results are consistent with a first-order phase transition in crossing from the BSP to the D-A phase and a second-order phase transition from the D-A phase to the low pressure orientationally disordered phase. {\textcopyright} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

Theory has also suggested that this fluid state, representing a new state of matter, might have unusual properties governed by quantum effects, such as superfluidity or superconductivity. Here, by combining Raman spectroscopy and in situ higherature, high-pressure techniques, we demonstrate that above 200 GPa a new phase transition occurs as temperature is increased, for example 480 K at 255 GPa. If the transformation is interpreted as melting, it would be the lowest melting temperature of any material at these high pressures. We also find a new triple point between phases I and IV and the new phase, and demonstrate that hydrogen retains its molecular character around this point.

We also perform electron-phonon coupling calculations using the direct method to sample the vibrational Brillouin zone with grids of unprecedented size, which enables us to investigate the convergence of the zero-point renormalization to the thermal and optical band gaps of diamond.},
