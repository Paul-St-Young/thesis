We introduce a simple procedure, based on known properties of physical electronic densities, to make the variance of the Hellmann-Feynman estimator finite. We obtain very accurate geometries for the molecules H 2, LiH, CH4, NH3, H2O, and HF, with a Slater-Jastrow trial wave function. Harmonic frequencies for diatomics are also in good agreement with experiment. An antithetical sampling method is also discussed for additional reduction of the variance. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

Can machine learning enable similar breakthroughs in understanding quantum many-body systems? Here we develop an efficient deep learning approach that enables spatially and chemically resolved insights into quantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems. We unify concepts from many-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks, which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal mol -1) predictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules of intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability. Further applications of our model for predicting atomic energies and local chemical potentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar electronic structure demonstrate the potential of machine learning for revealing insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.},

The finite-size correction of Chiesa et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 076404 (2006) is shown to be incomplete in systems of low symmetry. Beyond-leading-order corrections to the kinetic energy are found to be necessary at intermediate and high densities; we investigate the effect of adding such corrections to QMC data for the homogeneous electron gas. We analyze finite-size errors in two-dimensional systems and show that the leading-order behavior differs from that which has hitherto been supposed. We compare the efficiencies of different twist-averaging methods for reducing single-particle finite-size errors and we examine the performance of various finite-size extrapolation formulas. Finally, we investigate the system-size scaling of biases in diffusion QMC.},

abstract = {A comprehensive microscopic understanding of ambient liquid water is a major challenge for ab initio simulations as it simultaneously requires an accurate quantum mechanical description of the underlying potential energy surface (PES) as well as extensive sampling of configuration space. Due to the presence of light atoms (e.g. H or D), nuclear quantum fluctuations lead to observable changes in the structural properties of liquid water (e.g. isotope effects), and therefore provide yet another challenge for ab initio approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that the combination of dispersion-inclusive hybrid density functional theory (DFT), the Feynman discretised path-integral (PI) approach, and machine learning (ML) constitutes a versatile ab initio based framework that enables extensive sampling of both thermal and nuclear quantum fluctuations on a quite accurate underlying PES. In particular, we employ the recently developed deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) model–a neural-network representation of the ab initio PES–in conjunction with a PI approach based on the generalised Langevin equation (PIGLET) to investigate how isotope effects influence the structural properties of ambient liquid H2O and D2O . Through a detailed analysis of the interference differential cross sections as well as several radial and angular distribution functions, we demonstrate that this approach can furnish a semi-quantitative prediction of these subtle isotope effects.},

The critical point of the first-order LLPT is estimated to be above 2000K according to the equation of state. Moreover, the metallization pressure obtained from the jump of dc electrical conductivity almost coincides with the plateau of equation of state.},

abstract = {The universality of the relation between binding energy and interatomic separation occurs for metallic and covalent bonds in a wide range of situations, spanning diatomic-molecule energetics, chemisorption, bimetallic adhesion, cohesion in solids, and even interactions in nuclear matter. This has intrigued physicists for some time, and here we provide some insights into its origin. We considered the electron density distribution as the variable linking the total energy and interparticle separation. In the spirit of effective-medium theory, a host electron density as seen by each atom was computed. We found that in every case (cohesion, chemisorption, and diatomic molecules), the host electron density was, to a good approximation, a simple exponential function of interparticle separation. This arises primarily because of the essentially exponential decay of the electron density into vacancy sites, into interstitial regions, into the vacuum from surfaces, or into the vacuum from isolated atoms. This suggested a scaling of the electron density which provides a universal relationship between the scaled interatomic separation and the scaled electron density. This density scaling is key. We applied the scaling of the electron density to impurity-binding-energy host-electron-density curves computed via the effective-medium approximation. A universal energy electron-density relationship resulted. This could be combined with the previously noted universal relation between scaled electron density and interparticle separation to yield the universal binding-energy distance relation. First-principles values of cohesive energies of solids and the energetics of certain diatomic molecules were also correlated with host electron densities, despite the fact that these types of energies are fundamentally different from each other and from impurity binding energies. We found a universal relationship between energies and host electron densities for cohesion and certain diatomic molecules which was the same as the one discovered for impurity binding energies. This, together with the universal relationship between electron density and interatomic separation, helps one to understand how a single energy-distance relation could describe chemisorption and cohesion as well as diatomic energetics. {\textcopyright} 1988 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Hydrogen, being the first element in the periodic table, has the simplest electronic structure of any atom, and the hydrogen molecule contains the simplest covalent chemical bond. Nevertheless, the phase diagram of hydrogen is poorly understood. Determining the stable structures of solid hydrogen is a tremendous experimental challenge(1-3), because hydrogen atoms scatter X-rays only weakly, leading to low-resolution diffraction patterns. Theoretical studies encounter major diffculties owing to the small energy differences between structures and the importance of the zero-point motion of the protons. We have systematically investigated the zero-temperature phase diagram of solid hydrogen using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) electronic-structure methods(4), including the proton zero-point motion at the harmonic level. Our study leads to a radical revision of the DFT phase diagram of hydrogen up to nearly 400 GPa. That the most stable phases remain insulating to very high pressures eliminates a major discrepancy between theory(5) and experiment(6). One of our new phases is calculated to be stable over a wide range of pressures, and its vibrational properties agree with the available experimental data for phase III.},

abstract = {Statistical learning methods show great promise in providing an accurate prediction of materials and molecular properties, while minimizing the need for computationally demanding electronic structure calculations. The accuracy and transferability of these models are increased significantly by encoding into the learning procedure the fundamental symmetries of rotational and permutational invariance of scalar properties. However, the prediction of tensorial properties requires that the model respects the appropriate geometric transformations, rather than invariance, when the reference frame is rotated. We introduce a formalism that extends existing schemes and makes it possible to perform machine learning of tensorial properties of arbitrary rank, and for general molecular geometries. To demonstrate it, we derive a tensor kernel adapted to rotational symmetry, which is the natural generalization of the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel commonly used for the prediction of scalar properties at the atomic scale. The performance and generality of the approach is demonstrated by learning the instantaneous response to an external electric field of water oligomers of increasing complexity, from the isolated molecule to the condensed phase.},

abstract = {Inspired by Pople diagrams popular in quantum chemistry, we introduce a hierarchical scheme, based on the multilevel combination (C) technique, to combine various levels of approximations made when molecular energies are calculated. When combined with quantum machine learning (QML) models, the resulting CQML model is a generalized unified recursive kernel ridge regression that exploits correlations implicitly encoded in training data composed of multiple levels in multiple dimensions. Here, we have investigated up to three dimensions: chemical space, basis set, and electron correlation treatment. Numerical results have been obtained for atomization energies of a set of ∼7000 organic molecules with up to 7 atoms (not counting hydrogens) containing CHONFClS, as well as for ∼6000 constitutional isomers of C 7 H 10 O 2 . CQML learning curves for atomization energies suggest a dramatic reduction in necessary training samples calculated with the most accurate and costly method. In order to generate millisecond estimates of CCSD(T)/cc-pvdz atomization energies with prediction errors reaching chemical accuracy (∼1 kcal/mol), the CQML model requires only ∼100 training instances at CCSD(T)/cc-pvdz level, rather than thousands within conventional QML, while more training molecules are required at lower levels. Our results suggest a possibly favorable trade-off between various hierarchical approximations whose computational cost scales differently with electron number.},

abstract = {High P-T Raman spectra of hydrogen in the vibron and lattice mode regions were measured up to 300 GPa and 900 K using externally heated diamond anvil cell techniques. A new melting line determined from the disappearance of lattice mode excitations was measured directly for the first time above 140 GPa. The results differ from theoretical predictions and extrapolations from lower pressure melting relations. In addition, discontinuities in Raman frequencies are observed as a function of pressure and temperature indicative of phase transition at these conditions. The appearance of a new Raman feature near 2700 cm-1 at ∼300 GPa and 370 K indicates the transformation to a new crystalline phase. Theoretical calculations of the spectrum suggest the new phase is the proposed Cmca-4 metallic phase. The transition pressure is close to that of a recently reported transition observed on dynamic compression.},

abstract = {An efficient and robust on-the-fly machine learning force field method is developed and integrated into an electronic-structure code. This method realizes automatic generation of machine learning force fields on the basis of Bayesian inference during molecular dynamics simulations, where the first-principles calculations are only executed, when new configurations out of already sampled datasets appear. The developed method is applied to the calculation of melting points of Al, Si, Ge, Sn and MgO. The applications indicate that more than 99{\%} of the first-principles calculations are bypassed during the force field generation. This allows the machine to quickly construct first-principles datasets over wide phase spaces. Furthermore, with the help of the generated machine learning force fields, simulations are accelerated by a factor of thousand compared with first-principles calculations. Accuracies of the melting points calculated by the force fields are examined by thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the examination indicates that the machine learning force fields can quantitatively reproduce the first-principles melting points.},

We present a new approach to the systematic approximation of the first-principles PES of molecular liquids using the GAP (Gaussian Approximation Potential) framework. The approach allows us to create potentials at several different levels of accuracy in reproducing the true PES and thus to determine the level of quantum chemistry that is necessary to accurately predict macroscopic properties. We test the approach by building a series of many-body potentials for liquid methane (CH 4 ), which is difficult to model from first principles because its behavior is dominated by weak dispersion interactions with a significant many-body component. The increasing accuracy of the potentials in predicting the bulk density correlates with their fidelity to the true PES, whereas the trend with the empirical potentials tested is surprisingly the opposite. We conclude that an accurate, consistent prediction of its bulk density across wide ranges of temperature and pressure requires not only many-body dispersion but also quantum nuclear effects to be modeled accurately.},

The existence and precise location of the transition line is relevant for planetary models. Recent experiments reported contrasting results about the location of the transition. Theoretical results based on density functional theory are also very scattered. We report highly accurate coupled electron–ion Monte Carlo calculations of this transition, finding results that lie between the two experimental predictions, close to that measured in diamond anvil cell experiments but at 25–30 GPa higher pressure.

The data suggest that the transition sequence at these temperatures proceeds by formation of disordered stacking of molecular and distorted layers. Weaker spectral changes are observed at 250, 285, and 300 GPa, that are characterized by discontinuities in pressure shifts of Raman frequencies, and changes in intensities and linewidths. The results indicate changes in structure and bonding, molecular orientational order, and electronic structure of dense hydrogen at these conditions.

abstract = {We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighborhood environments, and analyze their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

Proper groupings of the second- and third-order elastic moduli are shown to yield expressions that depend solely on either the electron density function or the pair potential and which therefore facilitate the construction of EAM models. This formulation also makes evident some important restrictions on the EAM functions and lattice summations. In order for the EAM to model the anharmonic properties accurately, (a) at least the third-nearest-neighbor interactions must be included in the expressions for the cohesive energies of both the body-centered-cubic and face-centered-cubic metals and (b) an electron density function of an inverse power form, as has been employed previously, generally is not valid. Specific EAM models are constructed for a diverse selection of metals (i.e., aluminum, copper, sodium, and molybdenum). These models identically reproduce the respective second- and third-order elastic moduli, as well as the binding energy, atomic volume, unrelaxed vacancy formation energy, and Roseșs universal equation of state.

abstract = {The high-pressure response of cryogenic liquid deuterium (LD2) has been studied to pressures of ∼400GPa and densities of ∼1.5g/cm3. Using intense magnetic pressure produced by the Sandia National Laboratories Z accelerator, macroscopic aluminum or titanium flyer plates, several mm in lateral dimensions and a few hundred microns in thickness, have been launched to velocities in excess of 22 km/s, producing constant pressure drive times of approximately 30 ns in plate impact, shock wave experiments. This flyer plate technique was used to perform shock wave experiments on LD2 to examine its high-pressure equation of state. Using an impedance matching method, Hugoniot measurements of LD2 were obtained in the pressure range of ∼22–100GPa. Results of these experiments indicate a peak compression ratio of approximately 4.3 on the Hugoniot. In contrast, previously reported Hugoniot states inferred from laser-driven experiments indicate a peak compression ratio of approximately 5.5–6 in this same pressure range. The stiff Hugoniot response observed in the present impedance matching experiments was confirmed in simultaneous, independent measurements of the relative transit times of shock waves reverberating within the sample cell, between the front aluminum drive plate and the rear sapphire window. The relative timing was found to be sensitive to the density compression along the principal Hugoniot. Finally, mechanical reshock measurements of LD2 using sapphire, aluminum, and $\alpha$-quartz anvils were made. These results also indicate a stiff response, in agreement with the Hugoniot and reverberating wave measurements. Using simple model-independent arguments based on wave propagation, the principal Hugoniot, reverberating wave, and sapphire anvil reshock measurements are shown to be internally self-consistent, making a strong case for a Hugoniot response with a maximum compression ratio of ∼4.3–4.5. The trends observed in the present data are in very good agreement with several ab initio models and a recent chemical picture model for LD2, but in disagreement with previously reported laser-driven shock results. Due to this disagreement, significant emphasis is placed on the discussion of uncertainties, and the potential systematic errors associated with each measurement.},

abstract = {We introduce a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for atomistic simulations of liquid and amorphous elemental carbon. Based on a machine learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT) potential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with a state-of-the-art empirical potential. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of "diamondlike" tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions ("graphitization"). The presented interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.},

abstract = {The most successful and popular machine learning models of atomic-scale properties derive their transferability from a locality ansatz. The properties of a large molecule or a bulk material are written as a sum over contributions that depend on the configurations within finite atom-centered environments. The obvious downside of this approach is that it cannot capture non-local, non-additive effects such as those arising due to long-range electrostatics or quantum interference. We propose a solution to this problem by introducing non-local representations of the system that are remapped as feature vectors that are defined locally and are equivariant in O(3). We consider in particular one form that has the same asymptotic behavior as the electrostatic potential. We demonstrate that this framework can capture non-local, long-range physics by building a model for the electrostatic energy of randomly distributed point-charges, for the unrelaxed binding curves of charged organic molecular dimers, and for the electronic dielectric response of liquid water. By combining a representation of the system that is sensitive to long-range correlations with the transferability of an atom-centered additive model, this method outperforms current state-of-the-art machine-learning schemes, and provides a conceptual framework to incorporate non-local physics into atomistic machine learning.},

We combine results from ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures, including immiscibility calculations, with a new nonperturbative calculation of Jupiter's zonal harmonic coefficients, to derive a self-consistent model for the planet's external gravity and moment of inertia. We assume helium rain modified the interior temperature and composition profiles. Our calculation predicts zonal harmonic values to which measurements can be compared. Although some models fit the observed (pre-Juno) second- and fourth-order zonal harmonics to within their error bars, our preferred reference model predicts a fourth-order zonal harmonic whose absolute value lies above the pre-Juno error bars. This model has a dense core of about 12 Earth masses, and a hydrogen-helium-rich envelope with approximately 3 times solar metallicity.},

abstract = {The success of first-principles electronic-structure calculation for predictive modeling in chemistry, solid-state physics, and materials science is constrained by the limitations on simulated length scales and timescales due to the computational cost and its scaling. Techniques based on machine-learning ideas for interpolating the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface without explicitly describing electrons have recently shown great promise, but accurately and efficiently fitting the physically relevant space of configurations remains a challenging goal. Here, we present a Gaussian approximation potential for silicon that achieves this milestone, accurately reproducing density-functional-theory reference results for a wide range of observable properties, including crystal, liquid, and amorphous bulk phases, as well as point, line, and plane defects. We demonstrate that this new potential enables calculations such as finite-temperature phase-boundary lines, self-diffusivity in the liquid, formation of the amorphous by slow quench, and dynamic brittle fracture, all of which are very expensive with a first-principles method. We show that the uncertainty quantification inherent to the Gaussian process regression framework gives a qualitative estimate of the potential's accuracy for a given atomic configuration. The success of this model shows that it is indeed possible to create a useful machine-learning-based interatomic potential that comprehensively describes a material on the atomic scale and serves as a template for the development of such models in the future.},

abstract = {An accurate understanding of the phase diagram of dense hydrogen and helium mixtures is a crucial component in the construction of accurate models of Jupiter, Saturn, and Jovian extrasolar planets. Though density-functional-theory-based first-principles methods have the potential to provide the accuracy and computational efficiency required for this task, recent benchmarking in hydrogen has shown that achieving this accuracy requires a judicious choice of functional, and a quantification of the errors introduced. In this work, we present a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) -based benchmarking study of a wide range of density functionals for use in hydrogen-helium mixtures at thermodynamic conditions relevant for Jovian planets. Not only do we continue our program of benchmarking energetics and pressures, but we deploy QMC-based force estimators and use them to gain insight into how well the local liquid structure is captured by different density functionals. We find that TPSS, BLYP, and vdW-DF are the most accurate functionals by most metrics, and that the enthalpy, energy, and pressure errors are very well behaved as a function of helium concentration. Beyond this, we highlight and analyze the major error trends and relative differences exhibited by the major classes of functionals, and we estimate the magnitudes of these effects when possible.},

abstract = {Transition path sampling techniques allow molecular dynamics simulations of complex systems to focus on rare dynamical events, providing insight into mechanisms and the ability to calculate rates inaccessible by ordinary dynamics simulations. While path sampling algorithms are conceptually as simple as importance sampling Monte Carlo, the technical complexity of their implementation has kept these techniques out of reach of the broad community. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use Python framework called OpenPathSampling (OPS) that facilitates path sampling for (bio)molecular systems with minimal effort and yet is still extensible. Interfaces to OpenMM and an internal dynamics engine for simple models are provided in the initial release, but new molecular simulation packages can easily be added. Multiple ready-to-use transition path sampling methodologies are implemented, including standard transition path sampling (TPS) between reactant and product states and transition interface sampling (TIS) and its replica exchange variant (RETIS), as well as recent multistate and multiset extensions of transition interface sampling (MSTIS, MISTIS). In addition, tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new path sampling schemes built on basic path sampling components. In this paper, we give an overview of the design of this framework and illustrate the simplicity of applying the available path sampling algorithms to a variety of benchmark problems.},

abstract = {Semiempirical potentials for silicon, germanium, and their alloys are derived with use of the modified-embedded-atom-method formalism. Following Baskes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 2666 (1987)], it is found that the host electron density which is a linear superposition of atomic densities in the embedded-atom method (EAM) must have an angular modification in order to properly describe the bond-bending forces in the diamond-cubic structure. The angular dependence of this host electron density was found to be in qualitative agreement with the density of a first-principles calculation. As in the EAM, the potential functions are determined by using the measured lattice constants, sublimation energies, elastic constants, and alloying energies of silicon and germanium. In addition, first-principles calculations of structural energies are used. The potentials are used to calculate the energetics and geometrics of point defects, surfaces, metastable structures, and small clusters. In all cases, the calculations have been compared to first-principles calculations and experiment when available. The calculations predict that the vacancy mechanism is the dominant diffusion mechanism in both silicon and germanium. Surface energies and relaxations of the low-index faces of Si and Ge are compared with first-principles calculations. {\textcopyright} 1989 The American Physical Society.},
