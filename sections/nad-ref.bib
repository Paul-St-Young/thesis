abstract = { ABSTRACT ABSTRACTWe report on the influence of the laser heating effect, potentially present in a Raman scattering experiment, on the behaviour of carbon phonon lines in the spectra of nanodiamond particles. Aside from the laser power used in the experiment, the extent of the thermal effect in question depends also on the nanodiamonds origin (obtained through detonation and high pressure high temperature techniques) as well as on the nanoparticles size. Laser heating should be properly taken into account when discussing Raman spectra of carbonaceous species, in particular, prior to addressing peak assignment and possible quantum confinement effects. },

abstract = {We report an improved Green's function quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the nonrelativistic ground-state energy of the hydrogen molecule, without the use of the Born-Oppenheimer or any other adiabatic approximations. A more accurate trial function for importance sampling and the use of the exact cancellation method combine to yield an energy which is a factor of 10 more accurate than that of previous quantum Monte Carlo calculations. The energy is less accurate than that of recently improved analytic variational calculations. The calculated energy is -1.164 0239 ±0.000 0009 hartree. Expressed as the dissociation energy and corrected for relativistic and radiative effects, the result is 36 117.84±0.20 cm-1, a value in agreement with the most recent experimental value 36 118.11±0.08 cm-1 obtained by Balakrishnan et al. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Ko??sos1970,
abstract = {In this chapter, the adiabatic theory for non-degenerate electronic states of diatomic molecules is reviewed and its possible refinements are discussed. Recent numerical results obtained for one- and two-electron molecules are used to discuss the accuracy of the adiabatic approximation by comparing the adiabatic results with the non-adiabatic or experimental ones, and also with those which result in the Born-Oppenheimer (clamped nuclei) approximation. The one- and two-electron molecules are the only real systems for which adiabatic calculations have been carried out. Results of these calculations may be exploited to get insight into the adiabatic approximation and its accuracy. For the dihydrogen cation accurate non-adiabatic calculations have been performed, and by comparing these results with those obtained in the adiabatic approach, one gets directly the magnitude of the non-adiabatic effects. For the H2 molecule, the non-adiabatic calculations are significantly more difficult, and at present, no accurate results are available. However, in this case, accurate experimental data exist. Since the relativistic corrections, which are usually neglected, are known to be very small, one may get insight into the magnitude of the non-adiabatic effects by comparing the adiabatic results with the experimental ones. The adiabatic results can also be discussed from a different point of view. Since most molecular computations are carried out in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, it is important to know how accurately it describes the vibronic states of molecules, and how different are the results obtained in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation from those resulting from the more consistent adiabatic theory.},

abstract = {Accurate ground‐state energies of the hydrogen molecule have been computed using wavefunctions in the form of expansions in elliptic coordinates and including explicitly the interelectronic distance. The computations have been made with 54‐term expansions (0.4≤R≤3.7) and with 80‐term expansions (0.5≤R≤2.0). For the equilibrium internuclear distance, the best total energies obtained in the two cases are —1.1744701 a.u. and —1.1744746 a.u., respectively, the corresponding binding energies being 38 291.8 and 38 292.7 cm—1. Employing the 54‐term wavefunctions, the relativistic corrections and the diagonal corrections for nuclear motion have been computed for several internuclear distances. For equilibrium their contributions to the binding energy have been found to be —0.526 and 4.947 cm—1, respectively. Thus the final theoretical binding energy for H2 amounts to 38 297.1 cm—1 and is a little larger than the experimental value 38 292.9±0.5 cm—1. The discrepancy may be due to the adiabatic approximation.},

We report the first fully ab initio calculations of nonadiabatic frequencies of a number of conventional (hcp Ti and Mg) and layered metals (MgB2, CaC6, and other intercalated graphites). Nonadiabatic effects can be spectacularly large (up to 30{\%} of the phonon frequencies) in both cases, but they can only be experimentally observed in the Raman spectra of layered compounds. In layered metals nonadiabatic effects are crucial to explaining the observed Raman shifts and linewidths. Moreover, we show that those quantities can be used to extract the electron momentum-relaxation time.},

@article{Tully1990,
abstract = {A method is proposed for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of processes that involve electronic transitions. The time dependent electronic Schrodinger equation is solved self-consistently with the classical mechanical equations of motion of the atoms. At each integration time step a decision is made whether to switch electronic states, according to probabilistic "fewest switches" algorithm. If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy. The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations for three one-dimensional, two-state models, two of which have been specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical-quantal dynamical theory. Although there are some discrepancies, initial indications are encouraging. The model should be applicable to a wide variety of gas-phase and condensed-phase phenomena occurring even down to thermal energies.},

In this work, we calculate the non-relativistic ground-state energies of atomic and molecular systems without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For this purpose, we utilize the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, in which the nodes depend on both the electronic and ionic positions. We report ground-state energies for all systems studied, ionization energies for the first-row atoms and atomization energies for the first-row hydrides. We find the ionization energies of the atoms to be nearly independent of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, within the accuracy of our results. The atomization energies of molecular systems, however, show small effects of the nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and nuclei.},

At such intersections the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, and unexpected dynamical processes result, which can be observed spectroscopically. We review the basic theory required to understand and describe conical, and related, intersections. A simple model is presented, which can be used to classify the different types of intersections known.
