Aside from the laser power used in the experiment, the extent of the thermal effect in question depends also on the nanodiamonds origin (obtained through detonation and high pressure high temperature techniques) as well as on the nanoparticles size. Laser heating should be properly taken into account when discussing Raman spectra of carbonaceous species, in particular, prior to addressing peak assignment and possible quantum confinement effects. },

abstract = {In this chapter, the adiabatic theory for non-degenerate electronic states of diatomic molecules is reviewed and its possible refinements are discussed. Recent numerical results obtained for one- and two-electron molecules are used to discuss the accuracy of the adiabatic approximation by comparing the adiabatic results with the non-adiabatic or experimental ones, and also with those which result in the Born-Oppenheimer (clamped nuclei) approximation. The one- and two-electron molecules are the only real systems for which adiabatic calculations have been carried out. Results of these calculations may be exploited to get insight into the adiabatic approximation and its accuracy. For the dihydrogen cation accurate non-adiabatic calculations have been performed, and by comparing these results with those obtained in the adiabatic approach, one gets directly the magnitude of the non-adiabatic effects. For the H2 molecule, the non-adiabatic calculations are significantly more difficult, and at present, no accurate results are available. However, in this case, accurate experimental data exist. Since the relativistic corrections, which are usually neglected, are known to be very small, one may get insight into the magnitude of the non-adiabatic effects by comparing the adiabatic results with the experimental ones. The adiabatic results can also be discussed from a different point of view. Since most molecular computations are carried out in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, it is important to know how accurately it describes the vibronic states of molecules, and how different are the results obtained in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation from those resulting from the more consistent adiabatic theory.},

Nonadiabatic effects can be spectacularly large (up to 30{\%} of the phonon frequencies) in both cases, but they can only be experimentally observed in the Raman spectra of layered compounds.

abstract = {A method is proposed for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of processes that involve electronic transitions. The time dependent electronic Schrodinger equation is solved self-consistently with the classical mechanical equations of motion of the atoms. At each integration time step a decision is made whether to switch electronic states, according to probabilistic "fewest switches" algorithm. If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy. The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations for three one-dimensional, two-state models, two of which have been specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical-quantal dynamical theory. Although there are some discrepancies, initial indications are encouraging. The model should be applicable to a wide variety of gas-phase and condensed-phase phenomena occurring even down to thermal energies.},

The computed vibrational quanta are larger than the observed ones by about 1 cm−1 while the theoretical rotational quanta are in a very good agreement with experiment.

For this purpose, we utilize the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, in which the nodes depend on both the electronic and ionic positions.

We find the ionization energies of the atoms to be nearly independent of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, within the accuracy of our results.

We review the basic theory required to understand and describe conical, and related, intersections. A simple model is presented, which can be used to classify the different types of intersections known.

Combined with the fractional-charge correction from recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC), a functional, the fractional-spin LOSC (FSLOSC), is proposed. FSLOSC, a correction to commonly used functional approximations, introduces the explicit derivative discontinuity and largely restores the flat-plane behavior of electronic energy at fractional charges and fractional spins. In addition to improving results from conventional functionals for the prediction of ionization potentials, electron affinities, quasiparticle spectra, and reaction barrier heights, FSLOSC properly describes the dissociation of ionic species, single bonds, and multiple bonds without breaking space or spin symmetry and corrects the spurious fractional-charge dissociation of heteroatom molecules of conventional functionals. Thus, FSLOSC demonstrates success in reducing delocalization error and including strong correlation, within low-cost density functional approximation.},

abstract = {We report a computational study of the effects of vibrational excitation of the hydrogen atom motion (i.e., excitation of the hydrogen bond asymmetric stretch mode) on proton transfer in solution. We use the method "molecular dynamics with quantum transitions" (MDQT) to properly treat the quantum mechanical nature of the hydrogen motion. Previously we applied MDQT to a model for the proton transfer reaction AH-B ⇄ A--+HB in liquid methyl chloride, where the AH-B complex corresponds to a typical phenol-amine complex. In that application, the hydrogen motion was treated quantum mechanically, and MDQT was used to incorporate transitions among the hydrogen quantum states into the molecular dynamics. It is a simple step to extend this approach to study the effects of vibrational excitation of the hydrogen motion. We show that, for this model system, the vibrational excitation significantly enhances the proton transfer rate for both hydrogen and deuterium, although the enhancement is much greater for deuterium. Thus, the proton transfer reaction is fast enough to couple with vibrational energy redistribution. We outline pictorially the competing pathways for vibrational relaxation and vibrationally assisted tunneling that we observed in the simulations. Our demonstration of the feasibility of the application of MDQT to photoinduced and photoassisted reactions should motivate further application of MDQT to such systems. More importantly, we hope that our results will motivate experimental investigations of vibrational excitation of the hydrogen bond asymmetric stretch mode in proton transfer reactions. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Accurate ground-state energies of the hydrogen molecule have been computed using wavefunctions in the form of expansions in elliptic coordinates and including explicitly the interelectronic distance. The computations have been made with 54-term expansions (0.4≤R≤3.7) and with 80-term expansions (0.5≤R≤2.0). For the equilibrium internuclear distance, the best total energies obtained in the two cases are -1.1744701 a.u. and -1.1744746 a.u., respectively, the corresponding binding energies being 38 291.8 and 38 292.7 cm-1. Employing the 54-term wavefunctions, the relativistic corrections and the diagonal corrections for nuclear motion have been computed for several internuclear distances. For equilibrium their contributions to the binding energy have been found to be -0.526 and 4.947 cm-1, respectively. Thus the final theoretical binding energy for H2 amounts to 38 297.1 cm-1 and is a little larger than the experimental value 38 292.9±0.5 cm-1. The discrepancy may be due to the adiabatic approximation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1964 by the American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is ubiquitous throughout chemistry and biology. This Perspective discusses recent advances and current challenges in the field of PCET, with an emphasis on the role of theory and computation. The fundamental theoretical concepts are summarized, and expressions for rate constants and kinetic isotope effects are provided. Computational methods for calculating reduction potentials and pKa's for molecular electrocatalysts, as well as insights into linear correlations and non-innocent ligands, are also described. In addition, computational methods for simulating the nonadiabatic dynamics of photoexcited PCET are discussed. Representative applications to PCET in solution, proteins, electrochemistry, and photoinduced processes are presented, highlighting the interplay between theoretical and experimental studies. The current challenges and suggested future directions are outlined for each type of application, concluding with an overall view to the future.},
