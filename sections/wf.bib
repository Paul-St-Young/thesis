The method is to determine the optimum Jastrow trial wave function by multiple iteration of the paired-phonon analysis, and then calculate the contributions of three-body factors in the wave function. Tables of values are given at several densities for the radial distribution function, Jastrow function, and liquid-structure function. We also present a variational formulation of the paired phonon analysis and numerical examples of its convergence and self-consistency. {\textcopyright} 1977 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The momentum distribution of the unpolarized uniform electron gas in its Fermi-liquid regime, n(k,r{\_}s), with the momenta k measured in units of the Fermi wave number k{\_}F and with the density parameter r{\_}s, is constructed with the help of the convex Kulik function G(x). It is assumed that {\$}n(0,r{\_}s), n(1{\^{}}\backslashpm, r{\_}s){\$}, the on-top pair density g(0,r{\_}s) and the kinetic energy t(r{\_}s) are known (respectively, from effective-potential calculations, from the solution of the Overhauser model, and from Quantum Monte Carlo calculations via the virial theorem). Information from the high- and the low-density limit, corresponding to the random-phase approximation and to the Wigner crystal limit, is used. The result is an accurate parametrization of n(k,r{\_}s), which fulfills most of the known exact constraints. It is in agreement with the effective-potential calculation of Takada and Yasuhara [1991 {\{}$\backslash$it Phys. Rev.{\}} B {\{}$\backslash$bf 44{\}} 7879], is compatible with Quantum Monte Carlo data, and is valid in the density range {\$}r{\_}s \backslashlesssim 12{\$}. The corresponding cumulant expansions of the pair density and of the static structure factor are discussed, and some exact limits are derived.},

abstract = {The energy of interaction between free electrons in an electron gas is considered. The interaction energy of electrons with parallel spin is known to be that of the space charges plus the exchange integrals, and these terms modify the shape of the wave functions but slightly. The interaction of the electrons with antiparallel spin, contains, in addition to the interaction of uniformly distributed space charges, another term. This term is due to the fact that the electrons repell each other and try to keep as far apart as possible. The total energy of the system will be decreased through the corresponding modification of the wave function. In the present paper it is attempted to calculate this "correlation energy" by an approximation method which is, essentially, a development of the energy by means of the Rayleigh-Schr{\"{o}}dinger perturbation theory in a power series of e2. {\textcopyright} 1934 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Wu1962,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The general scheme of the perturbation theory, in which the perturbation in the wavefunction is developed in a series of powers of the perturbation parameter, leads to divergent results for the lowest symmetrical wavefunction in the limiting case of an infinite number of particles. This difficulty can be avoided by applying a development of the logarithm of the wavefunction in powers of the perturbation parameter. Using the wavefunction so obtained, it is shown, that in the lowest state of a system of many interacting particles no density fluctuations occur. Some properties of the spectrum of energy levels of the many particles system are discussed, and a general proof is given of the existence of an "excitation energy", which is necessary to give one particle a motion relatively to the others. As a consequence one could expect that the specific heat of liquid helium II will increase as e(-a/T), and not with some power of T. {\textcopyright} 1940.},

abstract = {The behavior of the electrons in a dense electron gas is analyzed quantum-mechanically by a series of canonical transformations. The usual Hamiltonian corresponding to a system of individual electrons with Coulomb interactions is first re-expressed in such a way that the long-range part of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons is described in terms of collective fields, representing organized "plasma" oscillation of the system as a whole. The Hamiltonian then describes these collective fields plus a set of individual electrons which interact with the collective fields and with one another via short-range screened Coulomb interactions. There is, in addition, a set of subsidiary conditions on the system wave function which relate the field and particle variables. The field-particle interaction is eliminated to a high degree of approximation by a further canonical transformation to a new representation in which the Hamiltonian describes independent collective fields, with n′ degrees of freedom, plus the system of electrons interacting via screened Coulomb forces with a range of the order of the inter electronic distance. The new subsidiary conditions act only on the electronic wave functions; they strongly inhibit long wavelength electronic density fluctuations and act to reduce the number of individual electronic degrees of freedom by n′. The general properties of this system are discussed, and the methods and results obtained are related to the classical density fluctuation approach and Tomonaga's one-dimensional treatment of the degenerate Fermi gas. {\textcopyright} 1953 The American Physical Society.},
