abstract = {It is argued that the wave function representing an excitation in liquid helium should be nearly of the form if(ri)$\phi$, where $\phi$ is the ground-state wave function, f(r) is some function of position, and the sum is taken over each atom i. In the variational principle this trial function minimizes the energy if f(r)=exp(ik•r), the energy value being E(k)={\^{a}}2k22mS(k), where S(k) is the structure factor of the liquid for neutron scattering. For small k, E rises linearly (phonons). For larger k, S(k) has a maximum which makes a ring in the diffraction pattern and a minimum in the E(k) vs k curve. Near the minimum, E(k) behaves as $\Delta$+{\^{a}}2(k-k0)22$\mu$, which form Landau found agrees with the data on specific heat. The theoretical value of $\Delta$ is twice too high, however, indicating need of a better trial function. Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau. The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view is not adequate to deal with the details of the $\lambda$ transition and with problems of critical flow velocity. In a dilute solution of He3 atoms in He4, the He3 should move essentially as free particles but of higher effective mass. This mass is calculated, in an appendix, to be about six atomic mass units. {\textcopyright} 1954 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A wave function previously used to represent an excitation (phonon or roton) in liquid helium, inserted into a variational principle for the energy, gave an energy-momentum curve having the qualitative shape suggested by Landau; but the value computed for the minimum energy 6 of a roton was 19.1'K, while thermodynamic data require 6=9.6'K. A new wave function is proposed here. The new value computed for 6 is 11.5'K. Qualitatively, the wave function suggests that the roton is a kind of quantum-mechanical analog of a microscopic vortex ring, of diameter about equal to the atomic spacing. A forward motion of single atoms through the center of the ring is accompanied by a dipole distribution of returning Qow far from the ring. In the computation both the two-atom and three-atom correlation functions appear. The former is known from x-rays, while for the latter the Kirkwood approximation of a product of three two-atom correlation functions is used. A method is developed to estimate and correct for most of the error caused by this approximation, so that the residual uncertainty due to this source is negligible. 1.},

abstract = {The wave function describing the ground state of a boson system is approximated by the function $\Psi$=$\Pi$ exp[12u(rij)]. The superposition approximation is then used to derive a linear, inhomogeneous integral equation for dudr in which the only other quantities occuring are the experimentally observed two-particle distribution function g(r) and its first derivative. A numerical solution for He4 is computed and compared with the explicit approximate solution derived by Abe. Using the computed u(r) and a proper smooth extrapolation of g(r) into the region below the apparent cutoff at r=2.34 A, the kinetic energy of liquid He4 at absolute zero is estimated at 2.91×10-15 ergs/atom. A functional J(dudr) is constructed with the property that Abe's integral equation for dudr is just the Euler equation associated with the problem of finding a u for which J takes on an extreme value. The extreme value of J (actually a maximum) is simply related to the expectation value of the kinetic energy. The variational property is used to determine the best u(r) from a family of trial functions. The calculated value of the kinetic energy and the measured total energy are used, in conjunction with the virial theorem, to determine the coefficients of a 6-n Lennard-Jones potential. At n=12, the calculation yields a deeper potential well and a slightly wider repulsive region than is calculated from the properties of the gas phase. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Physical Society.},

The ground-state excess energies calculated by the Monte Carlo method are very precise and in agreement with those of other calculations in the metallic density range and in the very-low-density Wigner crystals. Three phases have been investigated: the Wigner crystal, the normal or unpolarized fluid, and the polarized fluid. The Wigner crystal has the lowest energy for rs{\textgreater}67 in three dimensions and rs{\textgreater}33 in two dimensions. The totally polarized quantum fluid is stable for 26{\textless}rs{\textless}67 in three dimensions and for 13{\textless}rs{\textless}33 in two dimensions, and the normal or unpolarized fluid is stable at higher densities rs{\textless}26 in three dimensions and rs{\textless}13 in two dimensions.

Our approach is based on the systematic expansion of the many-body wave function in terms of multibody correlations and is essentially exact up to adaptive truncation. The method is benchmarked by comparison to an exact Bethe ansatz or existing numerical results for the integrable Lieb-Liniger model. We first show that the many-body wave function achieves high precision for ground-state properties, including energy and first-order as well as second-order correlation functions. Then, we study the out-of-equilibrium, unitary dynamics induced by a quantum quench in the interaction strength. Our time-dependent variational Monte Carlo results are benchmarked by comparison to exact Bethe ansatz results available for a small number of particles, and are also compared to quench action results available for noninteracting initial states. Moreover, our approach allows us to study large particle numbers and general quench protocols, previously inaccessible beyond the mean-field level. Our results suggest that it is possible to find correlated initial states for which the long-term dynamics of local density fluctuations is close to the predictions of a simple Boltzmann ensemble.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The usual Hamiltonian corresponding to a system of individual electrons with Coulomb interactions is first re-expressed in such a way that the long-range part of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons is described in terms of collective fields, representing organized "plasma" oscillation of the system as a whole. The Hamiltonian then describes these collective fields plus a set of individual electrons which interact with the collective fields and with one another via short-range screened Coulomb interactions. There is, in addition, a set of subsidiary conditions on the system wave function which relate the field and particle variables. The field-particle interaction is eliminated to a high degree of approximation by a further canonical transformation to a new representation in which the Hamiltonian describes independent collective fields, with n′ degrees of freedom, plus the system of electrons interacting via screened Coulomb forces with a range of the order of the inter electronic distance. The new subsidiary conditions act only on the electronic wave functions; they strongly inhibit long wavelength electronic density fluctuations and act to reduce the number of individual electronic degrees of freedom by n′. The general properties of this system are discussed, and the methods and results obtained are related to the classical density fluctuation approach and Tomonaga's one-dimensional treatment of the degenerate Fermi gas. {\textcopyright} 1953 The American Physical Society.},
