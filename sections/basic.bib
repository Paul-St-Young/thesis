@article{Reynolds1982,
abstract = {The ground-state energies of H2, LiH, Li2, and H 2O are calculated by a fixed-node quantum Monte Carlo method, which is presented in detail. For each molecule, relatively simple trial wave functions $\psi$Τr are chosen. Each $\psi$Τconsists of a single Slater determinant of molecular orbitals multiplied by a product of pair-correlation (Jastrow) functions. These wave functions are used as importance functions in a stochastic approach that solves the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation by treating it as a diffusion equation. In this approach, $\psi$Τ serves as a "guiding function" for a random walk of the electrons through configuration space. In the fixed-node approximation used here, the diffusion process is confined to connected regions of space, bounded by the nodes (zeros) of $\psi$Τ. This approximation simplifies the treatment of Fermi statistics, since within each region an electronic probability amplitude is obtained which does not change sign. Within these approximate boundaries, however, the Fermi problem is solved exactly. The energy obtained by this procedure is shown to be an upper bound to the true energy. For the molecular systems treated, at least as much of the correlation energy is accounted for with the relatively simple $\psi$Τ's used here as by the best configuration interaction calculations presently available. {\textcopyright} 1982 American Institute of Physics.},

CEIMC can, in principle, overcome some of the limitations of the present DFT-based ab initio dynamical methods. The new method has recently been applied to high-pressure metallic hydrogen. Herein, we present a new sampling algorithm that we have developed in the framework of the reptation quantum Monte Carlo method chosen to sample the electronic degrees of freedom, thereby improving its efficiency. Moreover, we show herein that, at least for the case of metallic hydrogen, variational estimates of the electronic energies lead to an accurate sampling of the proton degrees of freedom. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {By utilizing the knowledge that a Hamiltonian is a unique functional of its ground-state density, the following fundamental connections between densities and Hamiltonians are revealed: Given that, are ground-level densities for interacting or noninteracting Hamiltonians H1, H2,HM (M arbitrarily large) with local potentials v1,v2,vM, but given that we do not know which belongs with which H, the correct mapping is possible and is obtained by minimizing dr[v1(r)(r)+v2(r)(r)+»vM(r)(r)] with respect to optimum permutations of the 's among the v's. A tight rigorous bound connects a density to its interacting ground-state energy via the one-body potential of the interacting system and the Kohn-Sham effective one-body potential of the auxiliary noninteracting system. A modified Kohn-Sham effective potential is defined such that its sum of lowest orbital energies equals the true interacting ground-state energy. Moreover, of all those effective potentials which differ by additive constants and which yield the true interacting ground-state density, this modified effective potential is the most invariant with respect to changes in the one-body potential of the true Hamiltonian. With the exception of the occurrence of certain linear dependencies, a density will not generally be associated with any ground-state wave function (is not wave function v representable) if that density can be generated by a special linear combination of three or more densities that arise from a common set of degenerate ground-state wave functions. Applicability of the "constrained search" approach to density-functional theory is emphasized for non-v-representable as well as for v-representable densities. In fact, a particular constrained ensemble search is revealed which provides a general sufficient condition for non-v representability by a wave function. The possible appearance of noninteger occupation numbers is discussed in connection with the existence of non-v representability for some Kohn-Sham noninteracting systems. {\textcopyright} 1982 The American Physical Society.},

Here, we show that the recently developed non-empirical strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) within the density functional theory framework predicts accurate geometries and energies of diversely bonded molecules and materials (including covalent, metallic, ionic, hydrogen and van der Waals bonds). This represents a significant improvement at comparable efficiency over its predecessors, the GGAs that currently dominate materials computation. Often, SCAN matches or improves on the accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost. SCAN is therefore expected to have a broad impact on chemistry and materials science.},

abstract = {We derive the exchange-correlation potential corresponding to the nonlocal van der Waals density functional. We use this potential for a self-consistent calculation of the ground state properties of a number of van der Waals complexes as well as crystalline silicon. For the latter, where little or no van der Waals interaction is expected, we find that the results are mostly determined by semilocal exchange and correlation as in standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA), with the fully nonlocal term giving little effect. On the other hand, our results for the van der Waals complexes show that the self-consistency has little effect on the atomic interaction energy and structure at equilibrium distances. This finding validates previous calculations with the same functional that treated the fully nonlocal term as a post-GGA perturbation. A comparison of our results with wave-function calculations demonstrates the usefulness of our approach. The exchange-correlation potential also allows us to calculate Hellmann-Feynman forces, hence providing the means for efficient geometry relaxations as well as unleashing the potential use of other standard techniques that depend on the self-consistent charge distribution. The nature of the van der Waals bond is discussed in terms of the self-consistent bonding charge. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder. {\textcopyright} 1981 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Sodium fluoride (NaF) has been shown to be cytotoxic and elicit inflammatory response in human. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying NaF-induced cytotoxicity in periodontal tissues have not yet been elucidated. This study is aimed to investigate the mechanisms of NaF-induced apoptosis in human gingival fibroblast (HGF). NaF decreased the cell viability of HGF in a dose- and time-dependent manner. NaF gave rise to apoptotic morphological changes including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. However, NaF did not affect the production of ROS. In addition, NaF augumented cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol, and enhanced caspase -9 and -3 activities., cleavage (85 kDa fragments) of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and upregulation of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) 1. These results demonstrated that NaF-induced apoptosis in HGF may be mediated with mitochondria. Furthermore, NaF elevated caspase-8 activity and upregulated Fas-ligand (Fas-L), suggesting involvement of death receptor mediated pathway in NaF-induced apoptosis. Expression of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, was downregulated, whereas expression of Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, was not affected in NaF-treated HGF. These results suggest that NaF induces apoptosis in HGF through both mitochondria- and death receptor-mediated pathway mediated by Bcl-2 family.},

We reproduce this surprising behavior using a minimal-basis model and, by comparing with the stretched H2 molecule, conclude that static (also known as nondynamical, near-degeneracy, first-order, or strong) correlation comes in two flavors: one that can be captured by UHF and another that cannot. In the former (Type A), there is an absolute near-degeneracy; in the latter (Type B), there is a relative near-degeneracy. This dichotomy clarifies discussions of static correlation effects. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The energy of interaction between free electrons in an electron gas is considered. The interaction energy of electrons with parallel spin is known to be that of the space charges plus the exchange integrals, and these terms modify the shape of the wave functions but slightly. The interaction of the electrons with antiparallel spin, contains, in addition to the interaction of uniformly distributed space charges, another term. This term is due to the fact that the electrons repell each other and try to keep as far apart as possible. The total energy of the system will be decreased through the corresponding modification of the wave function. In the present paper it is attempted to calculate this "correlation energy" by an approximation method which is, essentially, a development of the energy by means of the Rayleigh-Schr{\"{o}}dinger perturbation theory in a power series of e2. {\textcopyright} 1934 The American Physical Society.},

This difficulty can be avoided by applying a development of the logarithm of the wavefunction in powers of the perturbation parameter. Using the wavefunction so obtained, it is shown, that in the lowest state of a system of many interacting particles no density fluctuations occur. Some properties of the spectrum of energy levels of the many particles system are discussed, and a general proof is given of the existence of an "excitation energy", which is necessary to give one particle a motion relatively to the others. As a consequence one could expect that the specific heat of liquid helium II will increase as e(-a/T), and not with some power of T. {\textcopyright} 1940.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In particular, they compute the vibrational frequencies and binding energies of 26 first- and second-row diatomic molecules using post-Hartree-Fock methods, finding excellent agreement with the corresponding all-electron values.

abstract = {The management of simulation workflows represents a significant task for the individual computational researcher. Automation of the required tasks involved in simulation work can decrease the overall time to solution and reduce sources of human error. A new simulation workflow management system, Nexus, is presented to address these issues. Nexus is capable of automated job management on workstations and resources at several major supercomputing centers. Its modular design allows many quantum simulation codes to be supported within the same framework. Current support includes quantum Monte Carlo calculations with QMCPACK, density functional theory calculations with Quantum Espresso or VASP, and quantum chemical calculations with GAMESS. Users can compose workflows through a transparent, text-based interface, resembling the input file of a typical simulation code. A usage example is provided to illustrate the process.

The resulting wave functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using local density approximation orbitals in the trial wave function. However, compared to wave functions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wave functions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.},

They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision.

To identify the most accurate functional for dense hydrogen applications, we systematically benchmark some of the most commonly used functionals using Quantum Monte Carlo. By considering several measures of functional accuracy, we conclude that the van der Waals and hybrid functionals significantly out perform LDA and PBE. We support these conclusions by analyzing the impact of functional choice on structural optimization in the molecular solid, and on the location of the liquid-liquid phase transition.},

These issues are critically important to applications such as quantum annealing and electronics based on quantum phase transitions. Here, we use a quantum quench of disorder in an ultracold lattice gas to dynamically probe the superfluid-Bose glass quantum phase transition at non-zero temperature (Fig. 1). By measuring excitations generated during the quench, we provide evidence for superfluid puddles in the Bose glass phase and produce a superfluid-Bose glass phase diagram consistent with completely constrained, finite temperature, and equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The residual energy from the quench, which is an efficacy measure for optimization through quantum annealing, is unchanged for quench times spanning nearly a hundred tunnelling times.},

abstract = {The knowledge of the nodes of the many-fermion wave function would enable exact calculation of the properties of fermion systems by Monte Carlo methods. It is proved that fermion nodal regions have a tiling property, there is only one distinct kind of nodal region. All others are related to it by permutational symmetry. For some free particle systems, it is shown that there are only two nodal regions. An explicit form for the nodes of the many-fermion density matrix would enable exact simulations to be carried out at finite temperature. In the high-temperature limit, its nodes are related to Voronoi polyhedra. Two-dimensional cross sections of nodes are depicted. General computable families of fermion wave functions and density matrices are discussed.},
