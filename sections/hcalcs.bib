Here we examine the energy of solid hydrogen at high pressure in different structures, using density-functional theory augmented by the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Above a relative compression rho/rho(0) similar to 9 we report an orthorhombic structure, Cmca, that has lower energy (both static and zero-point) than the lowest-energy hcp structures, indicative of a possible layering or martensitic transition occurring in the vicinity of the recently observed high infrared activity.},

abstract = {A new phase V of hydrogen was recently claimed in experiments above 325 GPa and 300 K. Due to the extremely small sample size at such record pressures the measurements were limited to Raman spectroscopy. The experimental data on increase of pressure shows decreasing Raman activity and darkening of the sample, which suggests band-gap closure and impending molecular dissociation, but no definite conclusions could be reached. Furthermore, the available data is insufficient to determine the structure of phase V, which remains unknown. Introducing saddle-point {\$}ab{\$} {\$}initio{\$} random structure searching (sp-AIRSS), we find several new structural candidates of hydrogen which could describe the observed properties of phase V. We investigate hydrogen metallisation in the proposed candidate structures, and demonstrate that smaller band gaps are associated with longer bond lengths. We conclude that phase V is a stepping stone towards metallisation.},

Path integral Monte Carlo calculations model the orientational order-disorder transition of spatially symmetric molecules. Possible ordered molecular structures near 150 GPa pressure are examined in the local density approximation. It is shown that the discontinuity in the molecular vibron frequency versus pressure observed in this regime can be attributed to a combined band overlap and orientational transition. However, an orientationally inhomogeneous insulating phase may preempt the anticipated bulk transition along the 150 GPa experimental phase line.

Quasiharmonic vibrational calculations show that mixed structures are the most stable at room temperature over the pressure range 250-295 GPa. These structures are stabilized with respect to strongly bonded molecular phases at room temperature by the presence of lower frequency vibrational modes arising from the graphene-like sheets.

abstract = {The metallization of high-pressure hydrogen, together with the associated molecular to atomic transition, is one of the most important problems in the field of high-pressure physics. It is also currently a matter of intense debate due to the existence of conflicting experimental reports on the observation of metallic hydrogen on a diamond-anvil cell. Theoretical calculations have typically relied on a mean-field description of electronic correlation through density functional theory, a theory with well-known limitations in the description of metal-insulator transitions. In fact, the predictions of the pressure-driven dissociation of molecules in high-pressure hydrogen by density functional theory is strongly affected by the chosen exchange-correlation functional. In this Letter, we use quantum Monte Carlo calculations to study the molecular to atomic transition in hydrogen. We obtain a transition pressure of 447(3) GPa, in excellent agreement with the best experimental estimate of the transition 450 GPa based on an extrapolation to zero band gap from experimental measurements. Additionally, we find that C2/c is stable almost up to the molecular to atomic transition, in contrast to previous density functional theory (DFT) and DFT+quantum Monte Carlo studies which predict large stability regimes for intermediary molecular phases.},

abstract = {Glutamate is a main constituent of dietary protein and is also consumed in many prepared foods as an additive in the form of monosodium glutamate. Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that glutamate is a major oxidative fuel for the gut and that dietary glutamate is extensively metabolized in first pass by the intestine. Glutamate also is an important precursor for bioactive molecules, including glutathione, and functions as a key neurotransmitter. The dominant role of glutamate as an oxidative fuel may have therapeutic potential for improving function of the infant gut, which exhibits a high rate of epithelial cell turnover. Our recent studies in infant pigs show that when glutamate is fed at higher (4-fold) than normal dietary quantities, most glutamate molecules are either oxidized or metabolized by the mucosa into other nonessential amino acids. Glutamate is not considered to be a dietary essential, but recent studies suggest that the level of glutamate in the diet can affect the oxidation of some essential amino acids, namely leucine. Given that substantial oxidation of leucine occurs in the gut, ongoing studies are investigating whether dietary glutamate affects the oxidation of leucine in the intestinal epithelial cells. Our studies also suggest that at high dietary intakes, free glutamate may be absorbed by the stomach as well as the small intestine, thus implicating the gastric mucosa in the metabolism of dietary glutamate. Glutamate is a key excitatory amino acid, and metabolism and neural sensing of dietary glutamate in the developing gastric mucosa, which is poorly developed in premature infants, may play a functional role in gastric emptying. These and other recent reports raise the question as to the metabolic role of glutamate in gastric function. The physiologic significance of glutamate as an oxidative fuel and its potential role in gastric function during infancy are discussed.},

Among the four most competitive structures, i.e., C2/c-24, Cmca-12, Cmca-4, and I41/amd, only the atomic phase I41/amd can provide satisfactory interpretations of the recent experimental observation, and the electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) play a crucial role. Anharmonic effects (AHEs) due to lattice vibration are nonnegligible but not sufficient to account for the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the reflectance. The drop of the reflectance at 2 eV is not caused by diamond's band gap reducing or interband plasmon, but very likely by defect absorptions in diamond. These results provide theoretical support for the recent experimental realization of metallic hydrogen. The strong EPIs and the nonnegligible AHEs also emphasize the necessity for quantum treatment of both the electrons and the nuclei in future studies.},

abstract = {We performed simulations for solid molecular hydrogen at high pressures (250 GPa ≤ P ≤ 500 GPa) along two isotherms at T = 200 K (phase III) and at T = 414 K (phase IV). At T = 200 K, we considered likely candidates for phase III, the C2c and Cmca12 structures, while at T = 414 K in phase IV, we studied the Pc48 structure. We employed both Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo (CEIMC) and Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD). The latter is based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the van der Waals approximation (vdW-DF). The comparison between the two methods allows us to address the question of the accuracy of the exchange-correlation approximation of DFT for thermal and quantum protons without recurring to perturbation theories. In general, we find that atomic and molecular fluctuations in PIMD are larger than in CEIMC which suggests that the potential energy surface from vdW-DF is less structured than the one from quantum Monte Carlo. We find qualitatively different behaviors for systems prepared in the C2c structure for increasing pressure. Within PIMD, the C2c structure is dynamically partially stable for P ≤ 250 GPa only: it retains the symmetry of the molecular centers but not the molecular orientation; at intermediate pressures, it develops layered structures like Pbcn or Ibam and transforms to the metallic Cmca-4 structure at P ≥ 450 GPa. Instead, within CEIMC, the C2c structure is found to be dynamically stable at least up to 450 GPa; at increasing pressure, the molecular bond length increases and the nuclear correlation decreases. For the other two structures, the two methods are in qualitative agreement although quantitative differences remain. We discuss various structural properties and the electrical conductivity. We find that these structures become conducting around 350 GPa but the metallic Drude-like behavior is reached only at around 500 GPa, consistent with recent experimental claims.},

To discover the best candidates for phase III, density functional theory calculations within the metageneralized gradient approximation by means of the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semilocal density functional are employed. We study 11 molecular structures with different symmetries, which are the most competitive phases, within the pressure range of 100 to 500 GPa. The SCAN phase diagram predicts that the C2/c-24 and P6122-36 structures are the best candidates for phase III with an energy difference of less than 1 meV/atom. To verify the stability of the competitive insulator structures of C2/c-24 and P6122-36, we apply the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method to optimize the percentage $\alpha$ of exact exchange in the trial many-body wave function. We found that the optimized $\alpha$ equals 40{\%} and denote the corresponding exchange and correlation functional as PBE1. The energy gain with respect to the well-known hybrid functional PBE0, where $\alpha$=25{\%}, varies with density and structure. The PBE1-DMC enthalpy-pressure phase diagram predicts that the P6122-36 structure is stable up to 210 GPa, where it transforms to the C2/c-24.

abstract = {Identifying the atomic structure and properties of solid hydrogen under high pressures is a long-standing problem of high-pressure physics with far-reaching significance in planetary and materials science. Determining the pressure-temperature phase diagram of hydrogen is challenging for experiment and theory due to the extreme conditions and the required accuracy in the quantum mechanical treatment of the constituent electrons and nuclei, respectively. Here, we demonstrate explicitly that coupled cluster theory can serve as a computationally efficient theoretical tool to predict solid hydrogen phases with high accuracy. We present a first principles study of solid hydrogen phases at pressures ranging from 100 to 450 GPa. The computed static lattice enthalpies are compared to state-of-the-art diffusion Monte Carlo results and density functional theory calculations. Our coupled cluster theory results for the most stable phases including C2/c-24 and P21/c-24 are in good agreement with those obtained using diffusion Monte Carlo, with the exception of Cmca-4, which is predicted to be significantly less stable. We discuss the scope of the employed methods and how they can contribute as efficient and complementary theoretical tools to solve the long-standing puzzle of understanding solid hydrogen phases at high pressures.},

@article{Johnson2000,
abstract = {The possibility that steadily compressed hydrogen might undergo a transition from a proton-paired insulator to a monatomic metal was first suggested in 1935. But experimental realization of metallic hydrogen in solid form has remained elusive, despite studies at pressures as high as 342 GPa. The pairing structure is known to be robust (from the persistence of its associated vibron mode), leading to the suggestion of an alternative route to the metallic state, involving a band-overlap transition in which the pairing is preserved. Here we report density functional calculations within the local density approximation that predict a range of densities for hydrogen where a paired or molecular metallic state may be energetically preferred. The transition to this metallic state is naturally associated with the closing of an overall bandgap; but the pressures required to effect the transition are shown to change significantly when the gaps are corrected by approximate inclusion of many-electron effects. The implication is that a complete resolution of the structural and phase problem in dense hydrogen may require methods beyond the local density approximation.},

abstract = {Hydrogen, being the first element in the periodic table, has the simplest electronic structure of any atom, and the hydrogen molecule contains the simplest covalent chemical bond. Nevertheless, the phase diagram of hydrogen is poorly understood. Determining the stable structures of solid hydrogen is a tremendous experimental challenge(1-3), because hydrogen atoms scatter X-rays only weakly, leading to low-resolution diffraction patterns. Theoretical studies encounter major diffculties owing to the small energy differences between structures and the importance of the zero-point motion of the protons. We have systematically investigated the zero-temperature phase diagram of solid hydrogen using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) electronic-structure methods(4), including the proton zero-point motion at the harmonic level. Our study leads to a radical revision of the DFT phase diagram of hydrogen up to nearly 400 GPa. That the most stable phases remain insulating to very high pressures eliminates a major discrepancy between theory(5) and experiment(6). One of our new phases is calculated to be stable over a wide range of pressures, and its vibrational properties agree with the available experimental data for phase III.},

The effects of band-gap closure on the vibrational frequencies and those of the gradient correction to the LDA (the generalized-gradient approximation, GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy are also studied. In the structure of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice for the molecular centres, the mid-lying phonon modes whose frequencies lie in the range 1500 cm-1-1900 cm-1 at 100-200 GPa and the frequency difference between the in-phase and out-of-phase vibronic modes are in good agreement with experiments.

abstract = {Establishing the phase diagram of hydrogen is a major challenge for experimental and theoretical physics. Experiment alone cannot establish the atomic structure of solid hydrogen at high pressure, because hydrogen scatters X-rays only weakly. Instead, our understanding of the atomic structure is largely based on density functional theory (DFT). By comparing Raman spectra for low-energy structures found in DFT searches with experimental spectra, candidate atomic structures have been identified for each experimentally observed phase. Unfortunately, DFT predicts a metallic structure to be energetically favoured at a broad range of pressures up to 400 GPa, where it is known experimentally that hydrogen is non-metallic. Here we show that more advanced theoretical methods (diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations) find the metallic structure to be uncompetitive, and predict a phase diagram in reasonable agreement with experiment. This greatly strengthens the claim that the candidate atomic structures accurately model the experimentally observed phases.},
