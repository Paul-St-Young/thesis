The outlined technique shares similarities with electronic structure factor interpolation methods used in quantum Monte Carlo calculations. However, our approach does not require the calculation of density matrices. Furthermore we show that the proposed finite size corrections achieve chemical accuracy in the convergence of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation and coupled cluster singles and doubles correlation energies per atom for insulating solids with two atomic unit cells using 2 × 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 × 3 k-point meshes only.},

abstract = {An unambiguous crystallographic structure solution for the observed phases II-VI of high pressure hydrogen does not exist due to the failure of standard structural probes at extreme pressure. In this work we propose that nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides a complementary structural probe for high pressure hydrogen. We show that the best structural models available for phases II, III, and IV of high pressure hydrogen exhibit markedly distinct nuclear magnetic resonance spectra which could therefore be used to discriminate amongst them. As an example, we demonstrate how nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy could be used to establish whether phase III exhibits polymorphism. Our calculations also reveal a strong renormalization of the nuclear magnetic resonance response in hydrogen arising from quantum fluctuations, as well as a strong isotope effect. As the experimental techniques develop, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be expected to become a useful complementary structural probe in high pressure experiments.},

@article{Azadi2017,
abstract = {Glutamate is a main constituent of dietary protein and is also consumed in many prepared foods as an additive in the form of monosodium glutamate. Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that glutamate is a major oxidative fuel for the gut and that dietary glutamate is extensively metabolized in first pass by the intestine. Glutamate also is an important precursor for bioactive molecules, including glutathione, and functions as a key neurotransmitter. The dominant role of glutamate as an oxidative fuel may have therapeutic potential for improving function of the infant gut, which exhibits a high rate of epithelial cell turnover. Our recent studies in infant pigs show that when glutamate is fed at higher (4-fold) than normal dietary quantities, most glutamate molecules are either oxidized or metabolized by the mucosa into other nonessential amino acids. Glutamate is not considered to be a dietary essential, but recent studies suggest that the level of glutamate in the diet can affect the oxidation of some essential amino acids, namely leucine. Given that substantial oxidation of leucine occurs in the gut, ongoing studies are investigating whether dietary glutamate affects the oxidation of leucine in the intestinal epithelial cells. Our studies also suggest that at high dietary intakes, free glutamate may be absorbed by the stomach as well as the small intestine, thus implicating the gastric mucosa in the metabolism of dietary glutamate. Glutamate is a key excitatory amino acid, and metabolism and neural sensing of dietary glutamate in the developing gastric mucosa, which is poorly developed in premature infants, may play a functional role in gastric emptying. These and other recent reports raise the question as to the metabolic role of glutamate in gastric function. The physiologic significance of glutamate as an oxidative fuel and its potential role in gastric function during infancy are discussed.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic water oxidation is a fundamental process that sustains the biosphere. A Mn4Ca cluster embedded in the photosystem II protein environment is responsible for the production of atmospheric oxygen. Here, time-resolved x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) is used to observe the process of oxygen formation in real time. These experiments reveal that the oxygen evolution step, initiated by three sequential laser flashes, is accompanied by rapid (within 50 $\mu$s) changes to the Mn K$\beta$ XES spectrum. However, no oxidation of the Mn4Ca core above the all-MnIV state is detected to precede O-O bond formation, and the observed changes are therefore assigned to O-O bond-formation dynamics. We propose that O-O bond formation occurs prior to the transfer of the final (fourth) electron from the Mn4Ca cluster to the oxidized tyrosine TyrZ residue. This model resolves the kinetic limitations associated with O-O bond formation and suggests an evolutionary adaptation to avoid releasing harmful peroxide species.},

abstract = {A new phase V of hydrogen was recently claimed in experiments above 325 GPa and 300 K. Due to the extremely small sample size at such record pressures the measurements were limited to Raman spectroscopy. The experimental data on increase of pressure shows decreasing Raman activity and darkening of the sample, which suggests band-gap closure and impending molecular dissociation, but no definite conclusions could be reached. Furthermore, the available data is insufficient to determine the structure of phase V, which remains unknown. Introducing saddle-point {\$}ab{\$} {\$}initio{\$} random structure searching (sp-AIRSS), we find several new structural candidates of hydrogen which could describe the observed properties of phase V. We investigate hydrogen metallisation in the proposed candidate structures, and demonstrate that smaller band gaps are associated with longer bond lengths. We conclude that phase V is a stepping stone towards metallisation.},

abstract = {Identifying the atomic structure and properties of solid hydrogen under high pressures is a long-standing problem of high-pressure physics with far-reaching significance in planetary and materials science. Determining the pressure-temperature phase diagram of hydrogen is challenging for experiment and theory due to the extreme conditions and the required accuracy in the quantum mechanical treatment of the constituent electrons and nuclei, respectively. Here, we demonstrate explicitly that coupled cluster theory can serve as a computationally efficient theoretical tool to predict solid hydrogen phases with high accuracy. We present a first principles study of solid hydrogen phases at pressures ranging from 100 to 450 GPa. The computed static lattice enthalpies are compared to state-of-the-art diffusion Monte Carlo results and density functional theory calculations. Our coupled cluster theory results for the most stable phases including C2/c-24 and P21/c-24 are in good agreement with those obtained using diffusion Monte Carlo, with the exception of Cmca-4, which is predicted to be significantly less stable. We discuss the scope of the employed methods and how they can contribute as efficient and complementary theoretical tools to solve the long-standing puzzle of understanding solid hydrogen phases at high pressures.},

abstract = {The metallization of high-pressure hydrogen, together with the associated molecular to atomic transition, is one of the most important problems in the field of high-pressure physics. It is also currently a matter of intense debate due to the existence of conflicting experimental reports on the observation of metallic hydrogen on a diamond-anvil cell. Theoretical calculations have typically relied on a mean-field description of electronic correlation through density functional theory, a theory with well-known limitations in the description of metal-insulator transitions. In fact, the predictions of the pressure-driven dissociation of molecules in high-pressure hydrogen by density functional theory is strongly affected by the chosen exchange-correlation functional. In this Letter, we use quantum Monte Carlo calculations to study the molecular to atomic transition in hydrogen. We obtain a transition pressure of 447(3) GPa, in excellent agreement with the best experimental estimate of the transition 450 GPa based on an extrapolation to zero band gap from experimental measurements. Additionally, we find that C2/c is stable almost up to the molecular to atomic transition, in contrast to previous density functional theory (DFT) and DFT+quantum Monte Carlo studies which predict large stability regimes for intermediary molecular phases.},

abstract = {Establishing the phase diagram of hydrogen is a major challenge for experimental and theoretical physics. Experiment alone cannot establish the atomic structure of solid hydrogen at high pressure, because hydrogen scatters X-rays only weakly. Instead, our understanding of the atomic structure is largely based on density functional theory (DFT). By comparing Raman spectra for low-energy structures found in DFT searches with experimental spectra, candidate atomic structures have been identified for each experimentally observed phase. Unfortunately, DFT predicts a metallic structure to be energetically favoured at a broad range of pressures up to 400 GPa, where it is known experimentally that hydrogen is non-metallic. Here we show that more advanced theoretical methods (diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations) find the metallic structure to be uncompetitive, and predict a phase diagram in reasonable agreement with experiment. This greatly strengthens the claim that the candidate atomic structures accurately model the experimentally observed phases.},
