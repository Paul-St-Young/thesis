abstract = {We develop and test Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms that use a"twist" or a phase in the wave function for fermions in periodic boundary conditions. For metallic systems, averaging over the twist results in faster convergence to the thermodynamic limit than periodic boundary conditions for properties involving the kinetic energy and has the same computational complexity. We determine exponents for the rate of convergence to the thermodynamic limit for the components of the energy of coulomb systems. We show results with twist averaged variational Monte Carlo on free particles, the Stoner model and the electron gas using Hartree-Fock, Slater-Jastrow, and three-body and backflow wave function. We also discuss the use of twist averaging in the grand canonical ensemble, and numerical methods to accomplish the twist averaging.},

@article{Holzmann2003,
abstract = {We justify and evaluate backflow three-body wave functions for a two-component system of electrons and protons. Based on the generalized Feynman-Kacs formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band structure calculations, we analyze the use and the analytical form of the backflow function from different points of view. The resulting wave functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using local density approximation orbitals in the trial wave function. However, compared to wave functions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wave functions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.},

@article{Drummond2008,
abstract = {We analyze the problem of eliminating finite-size errors from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) energy data. We demonstrate that both (i) adding a recently proposed [ S. Chiesa et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 076404 (2006)] finite-size correction to the Ewald energy and (ii) using the model periodic Coulomb (MPC) interaction [ L. M. Fraser et al. Phys. Rev. B 53 1814 (1996); P. R. C. Kent et al. Phys. Rev. B 59 1917 (1999); A. J. Williamson et al. Phys. Rev. B 55 R4851 (1997)] are good solutions to the problem of removing finite-size effects from the interaction energy in cubic systems provided the exchange-correlation (XC) hole has converged with respect to system size. However, we find that the MPC interaction distorts the XC hole in finite systems, implying that the Ewald interaction should be used to generate the configuration distribution. The finite-size correction of Chiesa et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 076404 (2006) is shown to be incomplete in systems of low symmetry. Beyond-leading-order corrections to the kinetic energy are found to be necessary at intermediate and high densities; we investigate the effect of adding such corrections to QMC data for the homogeneous electron gas. We analyze finite-size errors in two-dimensional systems and show that the leading-order behavior differs from that which has hitherto been supposed. We compare the efficiencies of different twist-averaging methods for reducing single-particle finite-size errors and we examine the performance of various finite-size extrapolation formulas. Finally, we investigate the system-size scaling of biases in diffusion QMC.},
